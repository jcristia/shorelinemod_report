# Introduction

The health and functioning of coastal marine ecosystems are under threat from a variety of human activities [@Halpern2019]. Coastal activities such as agriculture, residential development, and logging can create pressures on the marine environment. A modified shoreline may exacerbate the impacts of these broad scale activities by altering levels of sedimentation, nutrient runoff, and pollution in the nearshore environment [@Dethier2016; @Todd2019]. For coastal biogenic habitat in British Columbia such as seagrass, modifications that harden the shoreline may decrease the ecosystem services that these habitats provide, e.g., buffering from wave energy and sea level rise (REFS). Furthermore, these pressures can impact seagrass productivity and survival, and thus impact the community of species that rely on seagrass [@Iacarella2018; @Murphy2021a; @Nahirnick2019]. Therefore, knowing the presence of shoreline modifications adjacent to seagrass meadows would allow us to better characterize potential ecological impacts to individual seagrass meadows and to understand seagrass ecosystem dynamics in a broader seascape context.

Assessing human activities for an entire coastal region is generally done at broad spatial scales. For example, impact mapping and assessments for all of BC have been done with a 2 km+ spatial resolution [@ClarkeMurray2015], which exceeds the size of many seagrass meadows as well as the size of the shoreline region which could be locally impacting a meadow. In addition, many spatially distinct meadows may exist close together, where only a high resolution assessment of shoreline modifications could distinguish the potential impacts between them. Fine-scale assessments of impacts to seagrass exist for the BC coast, but these are typically done in detail for only a few meadows due to logistical constraints [@Iacarella2018; @Nagel2020]. Ideally, impacts are quantified at broad and fine scales for entire regions. For example, along the Atlantic coast of Canada @Murphy2019 quantified activities at the Bay scale (i.e., activities occurring in the watershed or ocean but not overlapping with the meadow) and the local scale (occurring in or in close proximity to the meadow) for 180 seagrass meadows across two bioregions. Together, these analyses allow us to better understand the variation in anthropogenic influences on seagrass meadows and the seagrass-associated biological communities across bioregions and at multiple scales relevant to management efforts.

The objective of this project is to map and quantify the shoreline modifications adjacent to all known seagrass meadows in the Strait of Georgia Bioregion of British Columbia - a subset of the Salish Sea [@dfo2009]. Eelgrass (*Zostera marina*, the dominant habitat-forming seagrass species) is a conservation priority in the Northern Shelf Bioregion of British Columbia [@DFO2019; @Gale2019], and eelgrass meadows have been designated as Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSA) due to their productivity, sensitivity, and support for biological diversity [@Rubidge2020]. Therefore, it is important to acquire information on human activities to predict impacts and categorize meadows by their degree of naturalness, as areas of high naturalness may be a priority for additional management and conservation efforts [@UNCBD2008]. While shoreline modifications do not represent all of the human activities potentially threatening seagrass, a high resolution dataset is currently needed and can complement other existing human impact data.

# Methods

## Seagrass spatial data

Eelgrass (*Z. marina*) is the primary subtidal and intertidal meadow-forming seagrass in British Columbia. Meadows may also consist of the non-native seagrass, *Zostera japonica*, in the intertidal zone. Seagrass occurs to depths of up to 10 meters and can form meadows many km^2^ in size [@Murphy2021a]. We used a spatial dataset of seagrass in the Salish Sea compiled in @Cristiani2021, which consists of surveyed and modeled data from a variety of government and non-governmental sources. Due to the combination of data with varying collection methodologies and error, there is high uncertainty in the dataset, and it is best used for coarse estimates of extent. The dataset includes 685 spatially distinct meadows across the Strait of Georgia Bioregion as well as in the southern portions of the Northern Shelf Bioregion and Southern Shelf Bioregion (Figure \@ref(fig:studyareafig)).

## Shoreline area adjacent to seagrass meadows

Previous guidelines on the width of marine riparian buffer zones for protecting sensitive habitat typically range from 50-150 meters [@Lemieux2004; @Levings2001]. We followed the methodology in a similar study of anthropogenic impacts [@Iacarella2018] and examined shoreline modifications within 100 m of the coastline adjacent to each seagrass meadow. Quantifying modifications within a buffer zone requires generating consistent buffers from all meadows onto land. The perimeters of meadows, however, do not always exactly border the shoreline due to variable mapping accuracies and errors, as well as some meadows only existing in the subtidal zone. This would result in slightly different buffer extents on to land. Aside from a few exceptions, the majority of meadows are in close proximity to a coastline, and therefore, to create consistent width buffers on land we first adjusted the perimeter of meadows to match the coastline using digitization tools in ArcGIS.


## Quantifying shoreline modifications

To quantify shoreline modification adjacent to seagrass, we identified any structures (e.g. buildings, houses) and areas de-vegetated from their natural state (e.g. lawns, logged areas, agriculture, armoured shoreline) within the 100 meter buffer. De-vegetated areas can increase nutrient run-off from agricultural areas and sewage outfalls, potentially resulting in eutrophication [@hauxwell2003; @Quiros2017; @vandermeulen2005]. Hardened and de-vegated areas may also increase the outflow of sedimentation resulting in decreased light levels in seagrass meadows [@Dethier2016; @Todd2019; @Vandermeulen2012].

Shoreline modifications were digitized from satellite and aerial imagery in Google Earth Pro. The most recent imagery available was used, but the dates of the imagery varied across the study area. The majority of roads were included using an existing provincial dataset (Province of British Columbia - Digital Road Atlas). This dataset consists of linear features which were buffered using the number of lanes and standard lane widths. Modifications were classified into six categories: road, residential, agriculture, industrial, greenspace, and unclear. Within each category, an additional descriptor was also listed if relevant (Table \@ref(tab:modifications)). Overwater structures (e.g. floathomes, docks, aquaculture) were not considered to be shoreline modifications as these are associated with a different suite of impacts (e.g. shading, boat traffic), and these features were captured in separate studies [@cristiani2022; @Iacarella2019].

To quantify the overall level of shoreline modification we totaled the area of all modification types per buffered area and calculated the percent of the buffered area that is modified. The percent modified was then associated back with the adjacent seagrass meadow. 

```{r modifications}
d <- data.frame(
  Modification = c("Road", "Residential", "Industrial", "Agriculture", "Greenspace", "Unclear"),
  Subcategory_descriptors = c("paved; dirt; rail", "house; RV; lighthouse", "logging; airport; general development; parking; storage; marina; church; electrical; ferry; hospital; train yard; shipping", "crop; fishfarm", "cleared; campground; golf; park; recreation", "unclear") 
  )

kbl(d, "latex", align="cl", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Shoreline modification primary classifications and additional subcategory descriptors.",
    col.names = c("Modification", "Subcategory descriptors"),
    linesep = "\\addlinespace",
    position='h'
    ) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size=9) %>%
  column_spec(1, latex_valign="m", width="10em") %>%
  column_spec(2, latex_valign="m", width="30em") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE)
```

# Results

The spatial distribution of shoreline modifications varied across the region. Examples of the extent and diversity of modifications are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:exampleareas), and the full dataset is accessible online (see Data availability section). As expected, the seagrass meadows with the highest total levels of adjacent shoreline modification occurred near population centers (Figure \@ref(fig:percentmod)). The lowest levels of modification occurred near smaller islands and in the northern part of the study area (i.e. Johnstone Strait). The dominant modification type across the study area was residential development. Agriculture varied by latitude with most coastal agriculture occurring in the southern portion of the study area (Figure \@ref(fig:percentmodpertype)).

# Discussion

By quantifying shoreline modifications adjacent to seagrass meadows, we've provided a novel high resolution dataset for documenting land use over a large spatial extent and predicting potential impacts to nearshore ecosystems. The variation in the distribution and patterns of modifications across the region illustrate the different shoreline threats that seagrass meadows may face based on their location. While areas of high naturalness are generally targeted for conservation over degraded areas [@Rubidge2020; @UNCBD2008], other criteria such as biological diversity, productivity and connectivity may result in targeting meadows that are threatened by shoreline activities [@cristiani2022; @Rubidge2020]. If an area including a meadow is selected for management (e.g. an EBSA), then it's likely the shoreline modifications will have to be considered for possible mitigation of impacts. It will then be important to know the spatial distribution of modifications because the management action will vary with the type of modification.

This analysis could be strengthened by addressing some of its assumptions and limitations. We used a uniform buffer from the coast, but there is likely a distance-decay of the impacts from certain activities, such that subtidal meadows may experience impacts differently than intertidal meadows. In addition, a narrow buffer of vegetation on the edge of the coast could be enough to mitigate the effects of a certain modifications behind this buffer. Most importantly, it will be necessary to quantify the relative severity of each modification and the vulnerability of seagrass to different pressures. For example, runoff from agricultural areas may be more damaging than runoff from residential areas [@Teck2010]. Shoreline modifications are representative of only one type of threat to seagrass, however, by quantifying severity and vulnerability scores, this data could be incorporated into larger cumulative effects analyses in which the overall impact of many stressors is quantified [@ClarkeMurray2016; @ClarkeMurray2020; @Murphy2022].  

Our analysis emphasizes the importance of managing seagrass and the biodiversity it supports in the spatial context of the larger seascape and landscape. While seagrass area is declining globally, it appears to be stable in the north Pacific [@Dunic2021], and in the Washington state portion of the Salish Sea, seagrass has been resilient despite an increase in human activities [@Shelton2016]. To further enhance successful seagrass management, understanding exactly which activities may be impacting seagrass locally will likely require a more precise analysis of human activities, the stressors they generate, and the vulnerability of seagrass to these stressors. Therefore, it will be important to continue to gather the high resolution spatial data that informs the initial stage of these analyses.
