# Discussion

- summary paragraph
- spatial distribution of activities and the significance for management
- assumptions and limitations
  - No point measurements in field to confirm impacts. Some activities are well regulated in Canada, like logging, and there may be very minimal impact.
  - Meadows that arenâ€™t right on the coast may not experience any impacts
  - If the modification exists behind some vegetation then the impact may be less (cite Iacarella)
  - We use a uniform buffer, but there is a likely a distance decay for some of these activities.
- Future directions
  - incorporate vulnerability scores to specific types of modifications
  - Consider management goals of protecting the most natural meadows and how this might change given the spatial distribution of activities and other information (e.g. biodiversity in meadows, connectivity)

- some stuff from my thesis:
  - "managing seagrass habitat and associated species in a landscape context, in which patterns of distribution, dispersal, and impacts will interact to influence regional management strategies (Murphy et al. 2021b). Although eelgrass is declining globally (Dunic et al. 2021), eelgrass in nearby Puget Sound, Washington is stable and resilient overall, despite a significant increase in local human and climactic stressors (Shelton et al. 2016). Assessing the relevance of managing for human impacts in the Salish Sea will therefore require a deeper understanding of seagrass and invertebrate responses to stressors and the mechanisms (e.g., dispersal) that allow for resilience to these stressors. Ultimately, refining and validating our models will increase their utility and promote their incorporation into broader marine spatial planning efforts."
