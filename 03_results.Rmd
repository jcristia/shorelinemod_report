The spatial distribution of shoreline modifications varied across the region. Examples of the extent and diversity of modifications are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:exampleareas), and the full dataset is accessible online (see Data availability section). As expected, the seagrass meadows with the highest total levels of adjacent shoreline modification occurred near population centers (Figure \@ref(fig:percentmod)). The lowest levels of modification occurred near smaller islands and in the northern part of the study area (i.e. Johnstone Strait). The dominant modification type across the study area was residential development. Agriculture varied by latitude with most coastal agriculture occurring in the southern portion of the study area (Figure \@ref(fig:percentmodpertype)).
