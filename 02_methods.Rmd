# Methods

## Seagrass spatial data

- Seagrass, eelgrass, japonica
- Bioregions
- Data sources (ref my paper here)

## Shoreline area

- Justification (cite DFO reports, Iacarella, Nagel)
- Adjusting seagrass meadows (or just generally say we created it at the nearest shoreline)
- General geoprocessing steps

## Shoreline modifications

- Modifications we are looking for and why (Emily's 2020 paper has some additional citations for impacts that I don't have)
- Also, will need to say why I'm not including docks - its categorized elsewhere because of different impacts.
- digitizing - general rules
- attributes

## Postprocessing

- Roads
- General geoprocessing steps
- Calculate as percentage of buffer and associate as attribute
