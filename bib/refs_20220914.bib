The goal of this paper is to dispel the magic behind this black box. This tutorial focuses on building a solid intuition for how and why principal component analysis works; furthermore, it crystallizes this knowledge by deriving from simple intuitions, the mathematics behind PCA . This tutorial does not shy away from explaining the ideas informally, nor does it shy away from the mathematics. The hope is that by addressing both aspects, readers of all levels will be able to gain a better understanding of PCA as well as the when, the how and the why of applying this technique.},

Accumulating evidence suggests that such extinction debts pose a significant but often unrecognized challenge for biodiversity conservation across a wide range of taxa and ecosystems.

However, as long as a species that is predicted to become extinct still persists, there is time for conservation measures such as habitat restoration and landscape management. Standardized long-term monitoring, more high-quality empirical studies on different taxa and ecosystems and further development of analytical methods will help to better quantify extinction debt and protect biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation has long been consid- ered the primary cause for biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation worldwide, and is a key research topic in landscape ecology (Wu 2013). Habitat fragmentation often refers to the reduction of continuous tracts of habitat to smaller, spatially distinct remnant patches, and habitat loss typically occurs concurrently with habitat fragmentation (Col- linge 2009). Although some habitats are naturally patchy in terms of abiotic and biotic conditions (Wu and Loucks 1995), human actions have profoundly fragmented landscapes across the word (Haddad et al. 2015), altering the quality and connectivity of habitats. Therefore, understanding the causes and conse- quences of habitat fragmentation is critical to preserv- ing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. From May 4th to 10th, 2015, an International Workshop on Habitat Fragmentation and Biodiversity Conservation, held at the Thousand Island Lake, Zhejiang, China, discussed threats to biodiversity in fragmented landscapes and how fragmentation research can identify and help mitigate these threats. To meet these challenges, the Workshop had three goals. The first was to synthesize key findings in fragmentation science. Second was to identify impor- tant remaining research questions concerning the relationships between habitat fragmentation, biodi- versity, and ecosystem functioning at local, regional, and global scales. Finally, we examined the unique roles of field-based fragmentation experiments in addressing these questions. The Workshop's findings are relevant to the broader ecological community, and we present them here to stimulate research that will advance landscape ecology and conservation biology},

Here, we explore how reproductive schedule and larval behavior affect how much connectivity fluctuations depress growth. We combine larval dispersal simulations from the Florida Keys with theoretical results to calculate the effect of fluctuations on bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus). We find that fluctuations depress growth only slightly (∼2{\%}), but the effect would be much stronger for an organism that spawned only part of the year. Larval behavior can also matter, as vertical migration allows larvae to become entrained in eddies. Eddies synchronize connectivity fluctuations, further decreasing growth. However, here, they also divide the Keys into largely independently fluctuating regions, mitigating the effects of local synchrony. Therefore, in situations where connectivity fluctuations matter, the presence of independently fluctuating regions due to larval behavior may be important.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are increasingly exposed to elevated temperatures that can cause coral bleaching and high levels of mortality of corals and associated organisms. The temperature threshold for coral bleaching depends on the acclimation and adaptation of corals to the local maximum temperature regime. However, because of larval dispersal, coral populations can receive larvae from corals that are adapted to very different temperature regimes. We combine an offline particle tracking routine with output from a high-resolution physical oceanographic model to investigate whether connectivity of coral larvae between reefs of different thermal regimes could alter the thermal stress threshold (TST) of corals. Our results suggest that larval transport between reefs of widely varying temperatures is likely in the Coral Triangle, and that accounting for this connectivity may be important in bleaching predictions. This has important implications in conservation planning, because connectivity may allow some reefs to have an inherited heat tolerance that is higher or lower than predicted based on local conditions alone.

abstract = {Environmental filtering and dispersal limitation are important processes within the metacommunity concept. Non-random species turnover occurs in places where environmental filtering plays the key role in determining local community structure, whereas dispersal limitation causes nested patterns of species assemblages organized by non-random colonization processes. However, factors that modify the relative importance of these processes remain unclear for many ecosystems. We tested whether salinity gradient affect the relative importance of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation for structuring epifaunal and infaunal communities in three lagoons in Hokkaido, Japan, that have different salinity gradients. Specifically, we compared patterns of species diversity and similarity of eelgrass-associated invertebrate assemblages across space. Beta diversity (i.e., species turnover among different sites in each lagoon) was highest in Akkeshi, the lagoon with the salinity gradients. Variation partitioning of similarity components showed that spatial variation in the community assemblage pattern was mostly explained by environmental filtering in Akkeshi, but that it was explained more by species dispersal patterns and the difference in eelgrass biomass and shoot density in Notoro and Saroma, the lagoons without clear salinity gradient. Redundancy analysis showed that spatial variation in community structure was related to salinity and eelgrass biomass in Akkeshi, and to eelgrass aboveground biomass in Notoro and Saroma. Our findings highlight the effects of environmental heterogeneity on beta diversity and community structure and indicate that environmental gradients can be a key factor causing a shift in the relative importance of different metacommunity processes and the role of the foundation species in provisioning habitat.},

abstract = {Larval dispersal is a critically important yet enigmatic process in marine ecology, evolution, and conservation. Determining the distance and direction that tiny larvae travel in the open ocean continues to be a challenge. Our current understanding of larval dispersal patterns at management-relevant scales is principally and separately informed by genetic parentage data and biological-oceanographic (biophysical) models. Parentage datasets provide clear evidence of individual larval dispersal events, but their findings are spatially and temporally limited. Biophysical models offer a more complete picture of dispersal patterns at regional scales but are of uncertain accuracy. Here, we develop statistical techniques that integrate these two important sources of information on larval dispersal. We then apply these methods to an extensive genetic parentage dataset to successfully validate a high-resolution biophysical model for the economically important reef fish species Plectropomus maculatus in the southern Great Barrier Reef. Our results demonstrate that biophysical models can provide accurate descriptions of larval dispersal at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to management. They also show that genetic parentage datasets provide enough statistical power to exclude poor biophysical models. Biophysical models that included species-specific larval behaviour provided markedly better fits to the parentage data than assuming passive behaviour, but incorrect behavioural assumptions led to worse predictions than ignoring behaviour altogether. Our approach capitalises on the complementary strengths of genetic parentage datasets and high-resolution biophysical models to produce an accurate picture of larval dispersal patterns at regional scales. The results provide essential empirical support for the use of accurately parameterised biophysical larval dispersal models in marine spatial planning and management.},

However, empirical tests of this relationship have yielded mixed results, and alternative hypotheses have rarely been considered. Here we assess the relative influence of adult and larval-traits on geographic range size using a global dataset encompassing 590 species of tropical reef fishes in 47 families, the largest compilation of such data to date for any marine group. We analyze this database using linear mixed-effect models to control for phylogeny and geographical limits on range size. Our analysis indicates that three adult traits likely to affect the capacity of new colonizers to survive and establish reproductive populations (body size, schooling behavior, and nocturnal activity) are equal or better predictors of geographic range size than pelagic larval duration. We conclude that adult life-history traits that affect the postdispersal persistence of new populations are primary determinants of successful range extension and, consequently, of geographic range size among tropical reef fishes.},

abstract = {Aim To study the combined effects of climate change on connectivity between marine protected areas (MPAs) and larval supply to the continental shelf. Location The Mediterranean Sea, where sea surface temperatures are expected to strongly increase by the end of the 21st century, represents an archetypal situation with a dense MPA network but resource overexploitation outside. Methods Using an individual-based mechanistic model of larval transport, forced with an emission-driven regional climate change scenario for the Mediterranean Sea, we explored the combined effects of changes in hydrodynamics, adult reproductive timing and larval dispersal on the connectivity among MPAs and their ability to seed fished areas with larvae. Results We show that, over the period 1970–2099, larval dispersal distances would decrease by 10{\%}, the continental shelf area seeded with larvae would decrease by 3{\%} and the larval retention fraction would increase by 5{\%}, resulting in higher concentration of larvae in smaller areas of the continental shelf. However, connectance within the MPA network would increase by 5{\%} as more northern MPAs would become suitable for reproduction with increasing temperatures. We also show that the effects of changes in adult reproductive timing and larval dispersal on connectivity patterns are additive. Main conclusions Climate change will influence connectivity and the effectiveness of MPA networks, and should receive more attention in future conservation planning and large-scale population dynamics.},

Here, we survey fish assemblages in six Mediterranean no-take reserves and their adjacent fishing grounds using environmental DNA (eDNA) while controlling for environmental conditions. We detect less fish species in marine reserves than in nearby fished areas. The paradoxical gradient in species richness is accompanied by a marked change in fish species composition under different managements. This dissimilarity is mainly driven by species that are often overlooked by classical visual surveys but detected with eDNA: cryptobenthic, pelagic, and rare fishes.

@article{Altman2016,
abstract = {Little P value What are you trying to say Of significance? —Steve Ziliak The significance of experimental results is often assessed using P values and estimates of effect size. However, the interpreta-tion of these assessment tools can be invalidated by selection bias when testing multiple hypotheses, fitting multiple models or even informally selecting results that seem interesting after observing the data. Our goal this month will be to identify some circumstances that can give rise to such questionable practices— broadly termed 'P value hacking' and 'data dredging' . In addition, statistically significant results may not translate into biologically meaningful conclusions—with large sample sizes or small vari-ability, even tiny effects can be statistically significant. We have previously seen how to correctly interpret P values in the context of high-throughput 'omics' experiments in which the multiple testing is explicit 1 . We discussed the number of false discoveries that can be expected when a fixed P value is used to reject the null hypothesis. Here, to illustrate how P values can lead us astray, we reverse that process and instead ask: what is the smallest P value we can expect if the null hypothesis is true but we have done many tests, either explicitly or implicitly? Consider a study in which 10 physiological variables are mea-sured in 100 individuals to determine whether any of the vari-ables are predictive of systolic blood pressure (SBP). Suppose that none of the variables are actually predictive in the population and that they are all independent. If we use simple linear regression 2 and focus on one of the variables as a predictor, a test of associa-tion will yield P {\textless} 0.05 in 5{\%} of samples (Fig. 1a). However, if we test each of our predictors, there is now a 40{\%} chance that we'll find P {\textless} 0.05 for at least one. How does this arise? When we search for the most significant result, we do not have a fixed null hypothesis. It's entirely possible that a different predictor would be identified as most significant in the next repetition of the experiment. In reporting the most significant P value, we are actu-ally considering the distribution of the minimum of 10 random uni-form distributions (Fig. 1b). This distribution is readily computed and has density k(1 – x) k – 1 for k independent tests. Using k = 10, the probability of observing P {\textless} 0.05 is 1 – (1 – 0.05) 10 = 0.40 (Fig. 1b). Reporting a statistically significant result as if this were the only test performed is an example of selection bias and leads to inflated claims of statistical significance. It's important to realize that it does not matter whether or not the tests were actually performed—any choice of results based on the outcome, rather than on prespecified hypotheses, will lead to selection bias. We have previously seen that multiplicity adjustment is one way to fix selection bias for P values 1 . Using the adjusted P values from a family-wise error rate or false discovery rate guards against over-interpreting the P values when multiple testing has been done. However, it is less clear how to do this when an interesting effect has been detected after exploration of the data. For example, if we plotted SBP against each of our 10 predictors and felt that 1 predictor might have a quadratic relationship with SBP, should we adjust for 10 comparisons (the 10 plots), 20 comparisons (linear or quadratic effects) or more (to account for nonlinear relationships)? The more models we consider, the greater the danger of overfitting the data and producing false positives. A common suggestion for supplementing P values is to report the confidence interval for the effect. Does this assist with selec-tion bias? Figure 2 shows the confidence intervals corresponding to the testing scenarios in Figure 1. When we perform 100 single hypothesis tests when the null is true, only 5{\%} of the confidence intervals do not cover 0 (Fig. 2a). This picture looks very different if we consider only the most significant confidence interval from among 10 tests (Fig. 2b). On average, 40{\%} of the confidence inter-vals do not cover 0, which should not be surprising, as we've already shown that this is the fraction of the underlying P values that are less than 0.05 (Fig. 1b). Selection bias is not addressed or corrected merely by reporting both the P value and the confidence interval. Another common analysis in which P values can easily be mis-interpreted is the selection of a prediction model for multiple regression or classification. To show how this can occur, we per-formed 1,000 simulations of our 10 physiological variables that were, as before, random and independent of each other and of SBP. We then applied forward selection to identify variables that Figure 1 | P values are random variables. In assessing statistical significance, we rely on their distribution when the null hypothesis, H 0 ,is true. (a) Simulated P values from 1,000 statistical tests when H 0 is true. The distribution is uniform and, on average, 5{\%} of P {\textless} 0.05 (blue). (b) The distribution of the minimum P value across 1,000 simulations of 10 tests when H 0 is true.

abstract = {Connectivity is critical to the maintenance of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes, but its effects differ depending on the arrangement of linkages within a habitat network. Additionally, heterogeneity in habitat quality within the habitat network can alter patterns of diversity at local and regional scales in the metacommunity. Using a controlled experiment we examined the interactive effects of habitat connectivity, network form (linear vs square), and habitat patch quality on a moss-inhabiting microarthropod community. We fragmented moss habitat while controlling for habitat loss, and altered habitat patch quality by regulating moisture conditions in landscapes differing in patch arrangement. Habitat patch quality had a significant effect on patterns of species richness, extinction, abundance and biomass. The effects of network form on diversity were strongest in heterogeneous landscapes. Gamma and beta diversity were greatest in continuous and linear landscapes. However, linear habitat networks showed marked patch specific edge effects that were detrimental to diversity under heterogeneous conditions. We provide direct evidence that habitat network structure impacts species community properties through mass effects, that are most evident when heterogeneity in habitat patch quality is present within the network. We conclude that habitat quality at the individual patch level and the distribution of high-quality habitat within the network are important factors affecting biodiversity in metacommunities.},

abstract = {Life-history parameters were used to estimate the dispersal potential of 1021 marine macroinvertebrates recorded in species lists from 91 sites comprising rocky intertidal, subtidal, kelp forest, sandy beach, and soft-bottom habitats in Washington, Oregon, and California. Mean species richness was significantly greater in the California rocky subtidal habitat. Data on development mode, planktonic larval duration, rafting potential, and adult mobility were compiled, and summaries of the dispersal potentials of taxa within each habitat type were generated and compared. In summary, development mode was known or estimated for 76{\%} of species; larval planktonic duration for 49{\%}; adult mobility for 76{\%}; and rafting potential for 46{\%}. In comparisons of species' life-history traits among habitats, sand-dominated habitats were distinct from rocky habitats. In rocky habitats, ?42{\%} of species had planktonic feeding larvae, 43{\%} had planktonic nonfeeding larvae, and 15{\%} had nonplanktonic larvae. Sandy intertidal habitats had higher proportions of taxa with nondispersing, nonplanktonic larvae and lower proportions of planktonic feeding and nonfeeding larvae than all other sites. Soft-bottom subtidal communities had the highest proportion of taxa with planktonic feeding development and larvae with planktonic lifespans {\textgreater}30 d. Species in soft-bottom subtidal sites, therefore, have the greatest potential for extensive larval dispersal, whereas species in soft-bottom intertidal sites have the least potential for larval dispersal. In these sites with limited larval dispersal potential, there is greater potential for adult dispersal through adult movement and rafting. These differences in the dispersal potential of larvae and adults suggest that the effect of environmental changes and the effectiveness of reserves may differ between habitats. Conservation methods, including the use of marine reserves, must therefore be tailored to the habitat of interest if effective protection of community resources is to be achieved.},

Potential connectivity is calculated using a Lagrangian particle transport model coupled offline with currents generated by an oceanographic circulation model, MITgcm. The connectivity matrices show a surprising degree of self-recruitment and directional dispersal towards the northwest, from the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) to the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). We identify three predicted connectivity breaks in the archipelago, that is, areas in the mid and northern part of the archipelago that have limited connections with surrounding islands and reefs. Predicted regions of limited connectivity generally match observed patterns of genetic structure reported for coral reef species in the uninhabited NWHI, but multiple genetic breaks observed in the inhabited MHI are not explained by passive dispersal. The better congruence in our modeling results based on physical transport of passive particles in the low-lying atolls of the uninhabited NWHI, but not in the anthropogenically impacted high islands of the MHI begs the question: what ultimately controls connectivity in this system?},

abstract = {Modern coexistence theory is increasingly used to explain how differences between competing species lead to coexistence versus competitive exclusion. Although research testing this theory has focused on deterministic cases of competitive exclusion, in which the same species always wins, mounting evidence suggests that competitive exclusion is often historically contingent, such that whichever species happens to arrive first excludes the other. Coexistence theory predicts that historically contingent exclusion, known as priority effects, will occur when large destabilizing differences (positive frequency-dependent growth rates of competitors), combined with small fitness differences (differences in competitors' intrinsic growth rates and sensitivity to competition), create conditions under which neither species can invade an established population of its competitor. Here we extend the empirical application of modern coexistence theory to determine the conditions that promote priority effects. We conducted pairwise invasion tests with four strains of nectar-colonizing yeasts to determine how the destabilizing and fitness differences that drive priority effects are altered by two abiotic factors characterizing the nectar environment: Sugar concentration and pH. We found that higher sugar concentrations increased the likelihood of priority effects by reducing fitness differences between competing species. In contrast, higher pH did not change the likelihood of priority effects, but instead made competition more neutral by bringing both fitness differences and destabilizing differences closer to zero. This study demonstrates how the empirical partitioning of priority effects into fitness and destabilizing components can elucidate the pathways through which environmental conditions shape competitive interactions.},

abstract = {Many ocean species exist within what are called marine metapopulations: networks of otherwise isolated local populations connected by the exchange of larval offspring. In order to manage these species as effectively as possible (e.g., by esigning and implementing effective networks of marine protected areas), we must know how many offspring are produced within each local population (i.e., local demography), and where those offspring disperse (i.e., larval connectivity). Although there is much interest in estimating connectivity in the relatively simple sense of identifying the locations of spawning parents and their settled offspring, true measures of demographic connectivity that account for among-site variation in offspring production have been lacking. We combined detailed studies of local reproductive output and larval dispersal of a coral reef fish to quantify demographic connectivity when the levels of dispersal among populations are inferred by the collection of genetically "tagged" offspring. We estimated that 13.3{\%} of recruits returned to natal islands, on average (95{\%} CI = 1.1-50.3{\%}), that local retention was high on one of the islands (41{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 6.0-97.o{\%}), and that larval connectivity was appreciable, even between islands 129 km apart (mean = 1.6{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 0.20-8.8{\%}). Our results emphasize the importance of properly integrating measurements of production with measurements of connectivity. Had we not accounted for among-site variation in offspring production, our estimatese of connectivity would have been inaccurate by a factor as much as 6.5. At a generational timescale, lifetime offspring production varied substantially (a fivefold difference among islands) and the importance of each island to long-term metapopulaton growth was dictated by both larval production and connectivity. Atthe scale of our study (local populations inhabiting 5-ha reefs), the regional metapopulation could not grow without external input. However, an exploratory analysis simulating a network of four marine protected areas suggested that reserves of {\textgreater}65 ha each would ensure persistence of this network. Thus, integrating studies of larval connectivity and local demography hold promise for both managing and conserving marine metapopulations effectively.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of dispersal for population connectivity, dispersal is often costly to the individual. A major impediment to understanding connectivity has been a lack of data combining the movement of individuals and their survival to reproduction in the new habitat (realized connectivity). Although mortality often occurs during dispersal (an immediate cost), in many organisms costs are paid after dispersal (deferred costs). It is unclear how such deferred costs influence the mismatch between dispersal and realized connectivity. Through a series of experiments in the field and laboratory, we estimated both direct and indirect deferred costs in a marine bryozoan (Bugula neritina). We then used the empirical data to parameterize a theoretical model in order to formalize predictions about how dispersal costs influence realized connectivity. Individuals were more likely to colonize poor-quality habitat after prolonged dispersal durations. Individuals that colonized poor-quality habitat performed poorly after colonization because of some property of the habitat (an indirect deferred cost) rather than from prolonged dispersal per se (a direct deferred cost). Our theoretical model predicted that indirect deferred costs could result in nonlinear mismatches between spatial patterns of potential and realized connectivity. The deferred costs of dispersal are likely to be crucial for determining how well patterns of dispersal reflect realized connectivity. Ignoring these deferred costs could lead to inaccurate predictions of spatial population dynamics.},

To address this persistent barrier, we provide a general and accessible guide that covers the basic, step-by-step process of how to approach, understand, and use ecological theory in empirical work. We first give an overview of how and why mathematical theory is created, then outline four specific ways to use both mathematical and verbal theory to motivate empirical work, and finally present a practical tool kit for reading and understanding the mathematical aspects of ecological theory.

The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 because two types of mechanism may operate in combination6, 13, 14, 15. In the 'selection effect', dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the 'complementarity effect', resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics16, 17, 18, 19. Applying this method to data from the {pan-European} {BIODEPTH} experiment4 reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.},

Here we use a biophysical model of larval dispersal to estimate vertical connectivity of a broadcasting (Orbicella faveolata) and a brooding (Porites astreoides) species of coral in the US Virgin Islands. Modeling predicts subsidy to shallow areas by mesophotic larvae of both species based on local hydrology, adult reproductive characteristics, larval traits, and a wide range of scenarios developed to test depth-sensitive factors, such as fertilization rates and post-settlement survivorship. In extreme model scenarios of reduced fertilization and post-settlement survivorship of mesophotic larvae, 1–10 {\%} local mesophotic subsidy to shallow recruitment is predicted for both species, which are demographically significant. Although direct vertical connectivity is higher for the broadcaster, the brooder demonstrates higher local multigenerational vertical connectivity, which suggests that local P. astreoides populations are more resilient than those of O. faveolata, and corroborates field studies. As shallow habitat degrades, mesophotic–shallow subsidy is predicted to increase for both species. This study is the first of its kind to simulate larval dispersal and settlement between habitats of different depths, and these findings have local, regional, and global implications for predicting and managing coral reef persistence in a changing climate.},

abstract = {The Strait of Georgia (SoG), between Vancouver Island and mainland British Columbia, is a larval rearing ground for both hake and herring stocks, which are commercially important. Year-to-year variability in larval retention within the strait is examined by simulating drift tracks of larvae for these species using an ocean circulation model and a particle-tracking model. Larvae with different vertical swimming behaviors were tracked in the springs of 2007, 2008, and 2009. Since herring larvae mostly stay near the surface, their distribution is heavily influenced by the wind. Strong winds to the north soon after the hatching period tend to wash herring larvae out of SoG and winds to the south help retain herring larvae inside the Strait. In 2007, the model indicates a massive wind-driven export of herring larvae which may have led to the observed failure of herring production. In contrast, hake larvae reside deeper in the water column (50-200 m). Their distribution is less sensitive to surface forcing but is shaped by a deep gyre with cross-strait currents. This study also suggests that the northern and southern SoG are weakly connected for herring larvae dispersal, which makes both regions potentially important to recruitment. {\textcopyright} Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2014.

abstract = {Seagrasses cover about 0.1-0.2{\%} of the global ocean, and develop highly productive ecosystems which fulfil a key role in the coastal ecosystem. Widespread seagrass loss results from direct human impacts, including mechanical damage (by dredging, fishing, and anchoring), eutrophication, aquaculture, siltation, effects of coastal constructions, and food web alterations; and indirect human impacts, including negative effects of climate change (erosion by rising sea level, increased storms, increased ultraviolet irradiance), as well as from natural causes, such as cyclones and floods. The present review summarizes such threats and trends and considers likely changes to the 2025 time horizon. Present losses are expected to accelerate, particularly in South-east Asia and the Caribbean, as human pressure on the coastal zone grows. Positive human effects include increased legislation to protect seagrass, increased protection of coastal ecosystems, and enhanced efforts to monitor and restore the marine ecosystem. However, these positive effects are unlikely to balance the negative impacts, which are expected to be particularly prominent in developing tropical regions, where the capacity to implement conservation policies is limited. Uncertainties as to the present loss rate, derived from the paucity of coherent monitoring programmes, and the present inability to formulate reliable predictions as to the future rate of loss, represent a major barrier to the formulation of global conservation policies. Three key actions are needed to ensure the effective conservation of seagrass ecosystems: (1) the development of a coherent worldwide monitoring network, (2) the development of quantitative models predicting the responses of seagrasses to disturbance, and (3) the education of the public on the functions of seagrass meadows and the impacts of human activity},

We compared the responses of herbivore and plant communities to predator manipulations in 102 field experiments in six different ecosystems: lentic ( lake and pond), marine, and stream benthos, lentic and marine plankton, and terrestrial (grasslands and agricultural fields). Predator effects varied considerably among systems and were strongest in lentic and marine benthos and weakest in marine plankton and terrestrial food webs. Predator effects on herbivores were generally larger and more variable than on plants, suggesting that cascades often become attenuated at the plant– herbivore interface. Top-down control of plant biomass was stronger in water than on land; however, the differences among the five aquatic food webs were as great as those between wet and dry systems.},

For species with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersive larval phase, the effectiveness of MPA networks for population persistence depends on connectivity through larval dispersal. However, connectivity patterns between MPAs remain largely unknown at large spatial scales. Here, we used a biophysical model to evaluate connectivity between MPAs in the Mediterranean Sea, a region of extremely rich biodiversity that is currently protected by a system of approximately a hundred MPAs. The model was parameterized according to the dispersal capacity of the dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, an archetypal conservation-dependent species, with high economic importance and emblematic in the Mediterranean. Using various connectivity metrics and graph theory, we showed that Mediterranean MPAs are far from constituting a true, well-connected network. On average, each MPA was directly connected to four others and MPAs were clustered into several groups. Two MPAs (one in the Balearic Islands and one in Sardinia) emerged as crucial nodes for ensuring multi-generational connectivity. The high heterogeneity of MPA distribution, with low density in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, coupled with a mean dispersal distance of 120 km, leaves about 20{\%} of the continental shelf without any larval supply. This low connectivity, here demonstrated for a major Mediterranean species, poses new challenges for the creation of a future Mediterranean network of well-connected MPAs providing recruitment to the whole continental shelf. This issue is even more critical given that the expected reduction of pelagic larval duration following sea temperature rise will likely decrease connectivity even more.},

Here, we show that these methods are equivalent and interchangeable representations of the same information. Although pyramids are visually intuitive, explicitly linking them to size spectra connects pyramids to metabolic and size-based theory, and illuminates size-based constraints on pyramid shape. We show that bottom-heavy pyramids should predominate in the real world, whereas top-heavy pyramids indicate overestimation of predator abundance or energy subsidies. Making the link to ecological pyramids establishes size spectra as a central concept in ecosystem ecology, and provides a powerful framework both for understanding baseline expectations of community structure and for evaluating future scenarios under climate change and exploitation.},

Thus, quantitative estimates of the retention or dispersion of larvae from spawning grounds is important for the determination of recruitment success in fisheries. Models can be used to study connectivity through a dispersal curve or dispersal kernel: the probability that a larva will settle at a given distance from its release location. We applied a 3-dimensional circulation model and a Lagrangian particle tracking model to the southeast US continental shelf to describe dispersal kernels in 2 dimensions. We used a fully orthogonal design to assess the importance of fac- tors that influence the dispersal kernel, including spawning time, spawning location, larval behavior (vertical position in the water column), larval duration, and turbulent dispersal. Our results indicate that adult behavior, in the form of spawning time and location, may be more important than larval behavior in determining larval dispersal on the inner- and mid-shelves in this region},

This paper presents some fundamental aspects of LS modeling as they pertain to oceanography. The theory behind LS modeling is reviewed and an introduction to the substantial atmospheric literature on the subject is provided. One of the most important properties of an LS model is that it maintains an initially uniform distribution of particles uniform for all time-the well-mixed condition (WMC). Turbulent data for use in an oceanic LS model (LSM) are typically output at discrete positions by a general circulation model. Tests for the WMC are devised, and it is shown that for inhomogeneous turbulence the data output by an oceanic general circulation model is such that the WMC cannot be demonstrated. It is hypothesized that this is due to data resolution problems. To test this hypothesis analytical turbulence data are constructed and output at various resolutions to show that the WMC can only be demonstrated if the resolution is high enough (the required resolution depending on the inhomogeneity of the turbulence data). The output of an LSM represents one trial of possible ensemble and this paper seeks to learn the ensemble average properties of the dispersion. This relates to the number of particles or trials that are performed. Methods for determining the number of particles required to have statistical certainty in one's results are demonstrated, and two possible errors that can occur when using too few particles are shown.},

Whether protection should prioritize the connectivity structure or demographic characteristics of a given patch is still unclear. We design a three-stage population model to analyze the relative importance of sources, sinks, quality and extent of juvenile and adult habitat, and node centralities (eigenvector, degree, closeness, and betweenness) as a basis for prioritizing sites. We use a logistic-type stage-structured model to describe the local dynamics of a population with a sessile adult stage and network models to elucidate propagule-exchange dynamics. Our results show that the coupled states of habitat extent and quality, which determine population carrying capacity, are good criteria for protection strategy. Protecting sites on the basis of sources, sinks, or other centrality measures of connectivity becomes optimal only in limited situations, that is, when larval production is not dependent on the adult population. Our findings are robust to a diverse set of larval pathway structures and levels of larval retention, which indicates that the network topology may not be as important as carrying capacity in determining the fate of the metapopulation. Protecting extensive, good quality habitat can help achieve both conservation and fisheries objectives.},

abstract = {Seascape ecology has been widely applied to marine habitats, including seagrass meadows, through various approaches all over the world for the past 30 years. However, these methods mainly study seagrass meadows on a single spatial scale and monitor a single driver of heterogeneity. Additionally, few assess the seascape's structural evolution. This creates gaps between the scientific data provided and those required by environmental managers and stakeholders in charge of seagrass meadow conservation. To meet their expectations, in this paper we developed a new multidisciplinary approach based on the coupling of mapping techniques, particle flux, and biometric investigations in a Mediterranean Bay, the Calvi Bay (Corsica, France), to assess the structural changes of Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadows subject to disturbances. We focused our investigations on the structural characteristics, the spatial dynamics, and the particle fluxes of natural sand areas generated by bottom currents and dead matte patches which ensued from anchoring damages at 10, 15, and 20 m depth. Natural sand patches and anchoring patches differed in size, the first the largest. They also displayed different erosion-colonization dynamics. Natural sand patches were eroded at a mean speed of 12 cm.a −1 and colonized at a rate of 7 cm.a −1. Anchoring patches showed a mean erosion speed of 3.5 cm.a −1 and a colonization rate of 6.5 cm.a −1. Regarding particle fluxes, continuous meadow, and natural patch sedimentation and resuspension rates were 3.7 g DW .m −2 .d −1 and 4.1 g DW .m −2 .d −1 in average, respectively. In contrast, anchoring patches at 20 m depth acted as sediment traps (112.60 g DW .m −2 .d −1 in winter) and showed a higher particle resuspension rate. Our results highlighted the dichotomous dynamics of seagrass seascapes influenced by natural and anthropogenic factors. Thus, the smallest anchoring patch will take about 27 years to be recolonized while the biggest requires 60 years to be covered by the plant. With an upscaling approach, together with the newest mapping tools of marine habitats, we suggest a new method to study the evolution of seagrass meadows at a large spatial scale.},

This is especially true for nonnative species in native Zostera marina eelgrass beds in coastal British Columbia, Canada, which play a vital role in estuarine ecosystems. We tested how nonnative species richness and abundance were related to both arrival vectors and environmental factors in northeast Pacific eelgrass. Using correlation tests and generalized linear models, we examined how nonnative macroinvertebrates (benthic, epifaunal, and large mobile) and some algae species were related to arrival vectors (shipping and aquaculture) and environmental factors (climate variables, human population density, and native richness and abundance). We found 12 nonnative species, 50 {\%} with known negative impacts within eelgrass habitats. For benthic organisms, both nonnative richness and abundance were strongly correlated with shellfish aquaculture activities, and not with shipping activity. For epifaunal nonnative richness and abundance, neither vector was significantly correlated. Climate (temperature and salinity) helped explain nonnative richness but not abundance; there was no relationship of nonnative richness or abundance to native species richness and abundance or population density. Results suggest that aquaculture activities are responsible for many primary introductions of benthic nonnative species, and that temperature and salinity tolerances are responsible for post-introduction invasion success. While aquaculture and shipping vectors are becoming increasingly regulated to prevent further international spread of nonnative species, it will be important when managing nonnatives to consider secondary spread from intraregional transport through local shellfish aquaculture and shipping.},

We show that sur- rounding hedgerows and remnant habitat patches interact with the local floral diversity, bee diet breadth and bee body size to influence site occupancy, via colonisation and persistence dynamics. Florally diverse sites and generalist, small-bodied species are most important for maintaining metacommunity connectivity. By providing the first in-depth assessment of how a network of restored habitat influences long-term population dynamics, we confirm the conservation benefit of hedgerows for pollinator populations and demonstrate the importance of restoring and maintain- ing habitat networks within an inhospitable matrix.},

abstract = {Many marine organisms spend their early lives as planktonic larvae dispersed by ocean currents. Predictions of larval transport are important for a wide range of applications including the interpretation of population genetics, fisheries management, and the planning of no-take marine protected areas. A popular method for predicting larval transport is through the use of coupled ocean circulation and particle tracking models, termed "biophysical" models. Although much research has been done on the sensitivity and uncertainty of ocean circulation models, the sensitivity of particle tracking models for the assessment of larval transport has been largely overlooked. This study investigates the sensitivity of larval transport predictions to three input parameters universally required for particle tracking in biophysical models; namely the number of particles released, the particle release depth, and the particle tracking time. Using a three-dimensional biophysical model of the Southern California Bight, estimates of larval transport are quantified using a two-dimensional vertically-integrated particle density distribution (PDD) and the difference between PDDs is assessed using the fraction of unexplained variance (FUV). Overall, our study shows that larval transport predictions are sensitive to changes in all three input parameters and that the sensitivity is affected by the strength of mixing in the system. For the number of particles released, the FUV falls off rapidly as the number of particles increases. A minimum number of particles is identified that guarantees robustness of model predictions; this number increases as the complexity of the circulation patterns increases. For the particle release depth, the FUV between PDDs grew linearly as particles are released farther apart. The FUV is also inversely proportional to the strength of vertical mixing as the FUV is smaller in the winter when a deep mixed layer and weak stratification are present and larger in the summer when the system is strongly stratified. For the particle tracking time, the FUV between daily PDDs is much larger for short tracking times of 15. days or less than for longer tracking times of 20. days or more, showing a dependence on the length of time the particles take to be evenly mixed throughout the system. Our study quantifies the parameter sensitivity of larval transport predictions and presents a straightforward methodology to achieve robust predictions of larval transport from biophysical models. •Sensitivity study of larval transport predictions to particle tracking parameters•Predictions found to be sensitive to input parameters required for modeling•Importance of parameter selection for biophysical models evaluated•Methodology proposed to manage sensitivity and achieve model robustness•Sensitivity found to be proportional to the strength of mixing in the system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

With provisions for marine protected areas (MPAs) and integrated oceans management, the Oceans Act was meant to address the existing piecemeal approach to oceans management, by moving to a new approach founded in the concepts of sustainable development and ecosystem-based management. However, the past 13 years of implementation of the Act have highlighted a number of challenges that are affecting the degree to which oceans management is actually changing in the water. Most fundamental is the lack of adequate governance mechanisms that will ensure compliance by all parts of the Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and by other federal departments, and enhanced collaboration with all levels of government, including provinces, territories and First Nations. Coupled with inadequate funding, no timelines for completion of plans forMPAs, and the lack of accountability mechanisms, Canadas ocean estate continues to be managed on the piecemeal, sector-by-sector approach that the Oceans Act was meant to replace.More recently, global best practice inMPAestablishment ismoving to networks and hugeMPAs that are fully protected from all human activities, while broader oceans management is moving from an integrated approach to one that includes marine spatial planning and ocean zoning. Canada is just beginning to explore how these new practices could be implemented in its ocean estate, and needs to move more rapidly in order to better conserve and manage ocean ecosystems.},

Marine protected areas have been proposed to protect biodiversity, restore damaged ecosystems, sustain fisheries, and rebuild overexploited stocks. The effectiveness of marine protected areas depends in part on their effectiveness as connected networks, linked over large areas by ecological processes such as larval dispersal. Here, we applied a biophysical model driven by ocean currents derived from satellite altimetry to evaluate connectivity between Western Indian Ocean reefs. We applied graph-theoretic analysis, including clustering and a betweenness centrality metric. Our results show high interconnectivity within several regions (Mozambique Channel, Mascarene archipelago) and lower connectivity across the WIO region.

Questions remain on the identification of key drivers of dispersal and connectivity in marine populations as they can have multiple uses in the conservation and management of marine ecosystems. Here we investigate whether the open Kattegat, at the entrance to Baltic Sea, is the main source of recruitment to the benthos in associated estuaries and coastal sites through export of planktonic invertebrate larvae. We couple a 3D hydrodynamic ocean model (MIKE3FM) to an agent-based model and simulate the dispersal of macro-invertebrate populations in Danish waters. We use characteristic dispersal traits of the larval community (pelagic larval duration, spawning season, and settling behavior) and simulate dispersal processes within the muddy bottom habitats to derive recruitment rates and potential donor populations leading to population connectivity patterns on each site, one bay and two Danish fjords. We then use our recruitment results in the bay to compare them with field data on species diversity in the same area. A total of 48 different combinations of pelagic larval durations and spawning seasons of macro-invertebrates are simulated in two years 2004 and 2010. From these results, we conclude that the central and southern parts of the Danish waters are identified as important spawning grounds whereas the Kattegat does not seem to be the main provider of larvae into the selected sites. The model also predicts higher abundance and recruitment rates of macro-invertebrate larvae in 2010 compared to 2004. These results are supported by comparable species distribution data collected in the study area. Our results show the importance of an integrated modeling tool combining ocean circulation and biological traits to obtain a detailed description of dispersal and connectivity of macro-invertebrate community in the area, which can provide a more accurate baseline to manage marine biodiversity.},

abstract = {The performance and population dynamics of insect herbivores depend on the nutritive and defensive traits of their host plants1. The literature on plant-herbivore interactions focuses on plant trait means2,3,4, but recent studies showing the importance of plant genetic diversity for herbivores suggest that plant trait variance may be equally important5,6. The consequences of plant trait variance for herbivore performance, however, have been largely overlooked. Here we report an extensive assessment of the effects of within-population plant trait variance on herbivore performance using 457 performance datasets from 53 species of insect herbivores. We found that variance in plant nutritive traits substantially reduces mean herbivore performance via nonlinear averaging of performance relationships that were overwhelmingly concave-down. In contrast, relationships between herbivore performance and plant defense levels were typically linear, such that plant defense variance does not affect herbivore performance via nonlinear averaging. Our results demonstrate that plants contribute to the suppression of herbivore populations by having variable nutrient levels, not just by having low average quality as is typically thought. We propose that this phenomenon could play a key role in the suppression of herbivore populations in natural systems, and that increased nutrient heterogeneity within agricultural crops could contribute to the sustainable control of insect pests in agroecosystems.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMariah Meek ‏@mhmeek Oct 12$\backslash$r$\backslash$nGreat new paper in @nature by @wcwetzel @moria{\_}robinson and others on how plant diversity affects insects!},

abstract = {Fundamental knowledge of mortality during the planktonic phase of the typical marine life cycle is essential to understanding population dynamics and managing marine resources. However, estimating larval mortality is extremely challenging, because the fate of microscopic larvae cannot be tracked as they develop for weeks in ocean currents. We used a two-pronged approach to provide reliable estimates of larval mortality: (1) frequent, long-term sampling where the combination of larval behaviors and recirculation greatly reduces larval transport to and from the study area, and (2) an improved method of calculating larval mortality that consists of a vertical life table with a negative binomial distribution to account for the notorious patchiness of plankton. Larval mortality rates of our study species (barnacles and crabs) were ≤0.14 larvae/d, which produce survivorships over an order of magnitude higher than commonly determined for marine larvae. These estimates are reliable because they were similar for species with similar dispersal patterns. They are conservative because they were conducted in a highly advective upwelling system, and they may be even lower in other systems using our approach. Until other systems can be tested, our improved estimates should be used to inform future models of population dynamics and the evolution of life histories in the sea.},

The resulting edge detection is not based on the absolute strength of the front, but on the relative strength depending on the context thus, making the edge detection temperature-scale invariant. The performance of this algorithm is shown to be superior to that of simpler algorithms commonly used to locate edges in satellite-derived SST images.

abstract = {The dispersal stages of organisms with sessile adults must be able to select habitats with suitable environmental conditions for establishment and survival, and also must be able to reach those locations. For marine planktonic larvae, movement due to currents is often orders of magnitude greater than movement due to swimming behaviour. Current patterns are determined by interactions between underlying geography and tidal forces, modified by meteorological conditions. These linkages impose an area-specific focus to connectivity studies. Yet, how geographical features and meteorological forcing combine to produce specific current patterns and resultant connectivity among populations remains unclear. In this study of a complex fjordic region (the Firth of Lorn, Scotland), we followed tracks of generic particles driven by modelled hydrodynamic currents to investigate how connectivity between evenly spaced habitat sites varies in relation to coastal topography. We studied a range of larval durations (1-28 d), and two different but typical meteorological forcing scenarios. Particles released from regions of high current velocity, open coastline and low local habitat availability travelled furthest but were less likely to disperse successfully to other coastal sites. Extensive natal habitat in the vicinity of a site generally had a positive impact on the number of arriving particles, as did low current velocities. However, relationships between numbers of arriving particles and local geographical indices were complex, particularly at longer larval durations. Local geography alone explained up to 50{\%} of the variance in success of particles released and closer to 10{\%} of the variation in the number of particles arriving at each site. General patterns are evident, but coastline properties fall short of predicting dispersal measures for particular locations. The study shows that meteorological variation and broad scale current patterns interact strongly with local geography to determine connectivity in coastal areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

We then showcase some of the innovative applications of trajectory data, and conclude with some open questions and an outlook.

In recent years, this issue has increasingly been addressed using methodologies based on spatial network analysis. Here, we propose a hybrid approach based on network analysis tools and empirical habitat suitability models to integrate connectivity on decision-making. The study is focused on a pond system used by the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, in a coastal area in southwestern Iberia. The main objective of the study was to illustrate how the output of graph models may be useful to guide habitat management and planning. We assessed ponds according to three complementary structural and functional properties derived from a graph model: (1) pond importance as measured by the sensitivity of the overall connectivity to each pond loss, (2) pond coreness, used to identify the most cohesive pond subsystems and (3) pond betweenness, which measure the importance of ponds as stepping stones. The graph model took into account a resistance-to-movement surface, the maximum traveled distance and a habitat suitability model based on field sampling. Pond importance and coreness were shown to be positively related to occupancy, especially by turtle's youngest age classes, suggesting an important contribution of connectivity attributes for turtle populations. We discuss the ways these pond connectivity-related attributes may be helpful to assist and optimize management efforts for the conservation of the European pond turtle in the study area. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems-such as communities-through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with-what we believe to be-their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

The siting of protected areas to achieve management and conservation objectives draws heavily on biogeographic concepts of the spatial distribution and connectivity of species. However, the marine protected area (MPA) literature rarely acknowledges how biogeographic theories underpin MPA and MPA network design. We review which theories from biogeography have been incorporated into marine spatial planning and which relevant concepts have yet to be translated to inform the next generation of design principles. This biogeographic perspective will only become more relevant as climate change amplifies these spatial and temporal dynamics, and as species begin to shift in and out of existing MPAs. The scale of climate velocities predicted for the 21st century dwarfs all but the largest MPAs currently in place, raising the possibility that in coming decades many MPAs will no longer contain the species or assemblages they were established to protect. We present a number of design elements that could improve the success of MPAs and MPA networks in light of biogeographic processes and climate change. Biogeographically informed MPA networks of the future may resemble the habitat corridors currently being considered for many terrestrial regions.},

While seed germination and rhizome extension have been explored as modes of recovery and expansion, the contribution of seagrass viviparous propagules to meadow population dynamics has received little attention. Here, we investigated the potential of seagrass viviparous propagules to act as dispersal vectors. We performed a series of density surveys, and in situ and mesocosm-based experiments in Port Phillip Bay, VIC, Australia, using Zostera nigricaulis, a species known to produce viviparous propagules. Production of viviparous propagules was higher at sites with high wind and current exposure, compared to more sheltered environments. A number of propagules remained buoyant and healthy for more than 85 days, suggesting the capacity for relatively long-distance dispersal. Transplanted propagules were found to have improved survivorship within seagrass habitats compared to bare sediment over the short term (4 weeks); however, all propagules suffered longer-term ({\textless}100 days) mortality in field experiments. Conditions outside of meadows, including sediment scouring, reduced the likelihood of successful colonisation in bare sediment. Furthermore, sediment characteristics within meadows, such as a smaller grain size and high organic content, positively influenced propagule establishment. This research provides preliminary evidence that propagules have the potential to act as an important long-distance dispersal vector, a process that has previously gone unrecognised. Even though successful establishment of propagules may be rare, viviparous propagules show great potential for seagrass populations given they are facing global decline.},

We propose that biodiversity provides spatial insurance for ecosystem functioning by virtue of spatial exchanges among local systems in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore this hypothesis by using a simple theoretical metacommunity model with explicit local consumer-resource dynamics and dispersal among systems. Our model shows that variation in dispersal rate affects the temporal mean and variability of ecosystem productivity strongly and nonmonotonically through two mechanisms: spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species that tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates, and functional compensations between species that are made possible by the maintenance of species diversity. The spatial insurance effects of species diversity are highest at the intermediate dispersal rates that maximize local diversity. These results have profound implications for conservation and management. Knowledge of spatial processes across ecosystems is critical to predict the effects of landscape changes on both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services.},

Better knowledge of inter-reef connectivity patterns would be useful in enabling better management of coral reef waters however. By employing a spatially explicit numerical modelling approach, we simulate larval dispersal through the central section of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), comprising over 1000 reefs, and identify spatial patterns in the inter-reef connectivity network using a community detection method from network science. This paper presents the modelling approach used and discusses the significance of the results. Inter-reef connectivity networks were estimated for 4 different coral species, and significant differences between them were found. We show how we can partition reefs into clusters, or "communities", that are sparsely connected with each other, and therefore identify important barriers to larval dispersal. By fine-tuning a resolution parameter in the community detection method, we can find dispersal barriers of varying strength.

abstract = {Which populations are replenished primarily by immigrants (open) and which by local production (closed) remains an important question for management with implications for response to exploitation, protection, and disturbance. However, we lack methods for predicting population openness. Here, we develop a model for openness and show that considering habitat isolation explains the existence of surprisingly closed populations in high-dispersal species, including many marine organisms. Relatively closed populations are expected when patch spacing is more than twice the standard deviation of a species'. dispersal kernel. In addition, natural scales of habitat patchiness on coral reefs are sufficient to create both largely open and largely closed populations. Contrary to some previous interpretations, largely closed marine populations do not require mean dispersal distances that are unusually short, even for species with relatively long pelagic larval durations. We predict that habitat patchiness has strong control over population openness for many marine and terrestrial species with a highly dispersive life stage and relatively sedentary adults. This information can be used to make initial predictions about where populations will be more or less resilient to local exploitation and disturbance.},

abstract = {Finite volume ocean circulation and particle tracking models are used to simulate water-borne transmission of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) among Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms in the Discovery Islands region of British Columbia, Canada. Historical simulations for April and July 2010 are carried out to demonstrate the seasonal impact of river discharge, wind, ultra-violet (UV) radiation, and heat flux conditions on near-surface currents, viral dispersion and survival. Numerical particles released from infected farm fish in accordance with IHNV shedding rates estimated through laboratory experiments are dispersed by model oceanic flows. Viral particles are inactivated by ambient UV radiation levels and by the natural microbial community at rates derived through laboratory studies. Viral concentration maps showing temporal and spatial changes are produced and combined with lab-determined minimum infectious dosages to estimate the infective connectivity among farms. Results demonstrate that neighbouring na{\"{i}}ve farms can become exposed to IHNV via water-borne transport from an IHNV diseased farm, with a higher risk in April than July, and that many events in the sequence of farm outbreaks in 2001-2002 are consistent with higher risks in our farm connectivity matrix. Applications to other diseases, transfers between farmed and wild fish, and the effect of vaccinations are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2015 Foreman et al.

         {\textless}p{\textgreater}As global climate change and variability drive shifts in species' distributions, ecological communities are being reorganized. One approach to understand community change in response to climate change has been to characterize communities by a collective thermal preference, or Community Temperature Index (CTI), and then to compare changes in CTI with changes in temperature. However, important questions remain about whether and how responsive communities are to changes in their local thermal environments. We used CTI to analyze changes in 160 marine assemblages (fish and invertebrates) across the rapidly‐changing Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem and calculated expected community change based on historical relationships between species presence and temperature from a separate training dataset. We then compared interannual and long‐term temperature changes with expected community responses and observed community responses over both temporal scales. For these marine communities, we found that community composition as well as composition changes through time could be explained by species associations with bottom temperature. Individual species had non‐linear responses to changes in temperature, and these nonlinearities scaled up to a nonlinear relationship between CTI and temperature. On average, CTI increased by 0.36 °C (95 {\%} CI: 0.34‐0.38 °C) for every 1 °C increase in bottom temperature, but the relationship between CTI and temperature also depended on community composition. In addition, communities responded more strongly to interannual variation than to long‐term trends in temperature. We recommend that future research into climate‐driven community change accounts for nonlinear responses and examines ecological responses across a range of temporal and geographical scales.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

abstract = {Marine defaunation, or human-caused animal loss in the oceans, emerged forcefully only hundreds of years ago, whereas terrestrial defaunation has been occurring far longer. Though humans have caused few global marine extinctions, we have profoundly affected marine wildlife, altering the functioning and provisioning of services in every ocean. Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes. Though protected areas are a powerful tool to harness ocean productivity, especially when designed with future climate in mind, additional management strategies will be required. Overall, habitat degradation is likely to intensify as a major driver of marine wildlife loss. Proactive intervention can avert a marine defaunation disaster of the magnitude observed on land.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely adopted as the leading tool for coral-reef conservation, but resource users seldom accept them [1, 2], and many have failed to produce tangible conservation benefits [3]. Few studies have objectively and simultaneously examined the types of MPAs that are most effective in conserving reef resources and the socioeconomic factors responsible for effective conservation [4-6]. We simultaneously explored measures of reef and socioeconomic conservation success at four national parks, four comanaged reserves, and three traditionally managed areas in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Underwater visual censuses of key ecological indicators [7, 8] revealed that the average size and biomass of fishes were higher in all areas under traditional management and at one comanaged reserve when compared to nearby unmanaged areas. Socioeconomic assessments [6, 9, 10] revealed that this "effective conservation" was positively related to compliance, visibility of the reserve, and length of time the management had been in place but negatively related to market integration, wealth, and village population size. We suggest that in cases where the resources for enforcement are lacking, management regimes that are designed to meet community goals can achieve greater compliance and subsequent conservation success than regimes designed primarily for biodiversity conservation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Convention on Biological Diversity mandates the establishment of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks worldwide, with recommendations stating the importance of ‘ecological coherence,' a responsibility to support and perpetuate the existing ecosystem, implying the need to sustain population connectivity. While recommendations exist for integrating connectivity data into MPA planning, little advice exists on how to assess the connectivity of existing networks. This study makes use of recently observed larval characteristics and freely available models to demonstrate how such an assessment could be undertaken. The cold water coral (CWC) Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) is used as a model species, as much of the NE Atlantic MPA network has been designated for CWC reef protection, but the ecological coherence of the network has yet to be assessed. Simulations are run for different behavioural null models allowing a comparison of ‘passive' (current driven) and ‘active' (currents + vertical migration) dispersal, while an average prediction is used for MPA assessment. This model suggests that the network may support widespread larval exchange and has good local retention rates but still has room for improvement. The best performing MPAs were large and central to the network facilitating transport across local dispersal barriers. On average, passive and active dispersal simulations gave statistically similar results, providing encouragement to future local dispersal assessments where active characteristics are unknown.},

Mapped explanatory vari-ables included bioclimatic attributes related to primary envi-ronmental regimes: averages of annual precipitation, mini-mum temperature of the coldest month, maximum tempera-ture of the warmest month, and topographically-distributed potential solar insolation of the wettest quarter (winter) and of the growing season (spring). Also tested for significance were slope angle (related to soil depth) and the geographic coordi-nates of each observation. Models were parameterized and evaluated based on species presence/absence data from 906 plots surveyed on National Forest lands. Although all vari-ables were significant in at least one of the species' models, those models based only on the bioclimatic variables predicted species presence with 3 -26 {\%} error. While error would un-doubtedly be greater if the models were evaluated using inde-pendent data, results indicate that these models are useful for predictive mapping – for interpolating species distribution data within the ecoregion. All three methods produced models with similar accuracy for a given species; GAMs were useful for exploring the shape of the response functions, GLMs allowed those response functions to be parameterized and their significance tested, and classification trees, while some-times difficult to interpret, yielded the lowest prediction errors (lower by 3 -5 {\%}).},

abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that some populations of benthic marine organisms may be less demographically 'open' than previously thought. The degree to which a population receives recruits from local sources versus other populations has important ecological and management ramifications. For either of these reasons, it is often desirable to estimate the degree to which a population of interest is self-recruiting. Although methods for actual estimation of population self-recruitment are limited and often difficult to employ, the presence of several biological and physical conditions may improve our estimates of self-recruitment for particular populations. Biological traits of benthic adults (relative fecundity, spatial and temporal patterns of spawning and larval release, parental investment), as well as pelagic larvae (stage of development at hatching, pelagic larval duration, vertical migration behavior, horizontal swimming ability, and sensory capabilities) influence where and when larvae are released, where and how they are transported, their ability to move actively in the pelagic realm, and finally, spatial and temporal settlement patterns. Physical variables potentially influencing self-recruitment include site isolation, coastal complexity and flow variability. Within these physical variables we discuss explicit mechanisms by which larvae may be retained in proximity to their natal population. We provide examples from specific locations such as coral reefs, isolated islands and seamounts, and semi-enclosed embayments such as lagoons and estuaries, as well as characteristic oceanographic features such as upwelling systems, fronts, moving convergences, eddies and counter currents. We evaluate direct and indirect evidence to predict the relationship between these biophysical variables and the degree of self-recruitment in benthic marine organisms. We conclude that physical factors that result in a departure from unidirectional, depth-uniform water flow provide the opportunity for retention of larvae, and therefore of self-recruitment. These physical factors are common in the ocean and vary in intensity among locations and times. Some enable retention of passive larvae (physical retention), whereas others lead to retention only with active behavioral input by the larvae (biophysical retention). Larval behavior that can contribute to or result in retention or return to natal sites ranges from simple vertical orientation (within the capabilities of the larvae of most taxa) to complex sensory abilities and strong swimming (known to occur in larvae of a few taxa, particularly decapod crustaceans and fishes). For all taxa, both the pelagic larval duration and the time to behavioral competency will have a strong influence on likelihood of self-recruitment. Understanding the biophysical mechanisms by which larvae are retained near or return to their natal population will be necessary before generalizations can be made. Examples highlight the importance of each variable to processes controlling self-recruitment. For most correlates, further study is clearly warranted. Although certain variables hold promise for predicting self-recruitment, complex, non-linear interactions among these biophysical variables must be considered.},

Using experimental populations of the green alga Tetraselmis tetrahele grown over a range of temperatures in constant and fluctuating thermal regimes, we show that population growth rates in fluctuating thermal regimes can be accurately and quantitatively predicted based on performance in constant thermal regimes. We extrapolate from these results to predict how population growth and critical temperatures for persistence of 89 phytoplankton species assessed in constant conditions would differ in naturally variable thermal environments. Together these results demonstrate a key improvement upon our ability to predict population dynamics in the context of global change.},

abstract = {Humans are producing complex and often undesirable social and ecological outcomes in many landscapes around the world. To sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services in fragmented landscapes conservation planning has turned to the identification and protection of large-scale spatial ecological networks (SEN). Now widely adopted, this approach typically focuses on static connectivity, and ignores the feedbacks between changes to the network's topology and the eco-evolutionary dynamics on the network. We review theory showing that diversity, stability, ecosystem functioning and evolutionary adaptation all vary nonlinearly with connectivity. Measuring and modelling an SEN's long-term dynamics is immensely challenging but necessary if our goal is sustainability. We show an example where the robustness of an SEN's ecological properties to node and link loss depends on the centrality of the nodes targeted. The design and protection of sustainable SENs requires scenarios of how landscape change affects network structure and the feedback this will have on dynamics. Once established, SEN must be monitored if their design is to be adapted to keep their dynamics within a safe and socially just operating space. When SEN are co-designed with a broad array of stakeholders and actors they can be a powerful means of creating a more positive relationship between people and nature.},

abstract = {Recently, a debate has developed over how biodiversity is changing across the planet. While most researchers agree species extinctions are increasing globally due to human activity, some now argue that species richness at local scales is not declining as many biologists have claimed. This argument stems from recent syntheses of time-series data that suggest species richness is decreasing in some locations, increasing in others, but not changing on average. Critics of these syntheses (like us) have argued there are serious limitations of existing time-series datasets and their analyses that preclude meaningful conclusions about local biodiversity change. Specifically, authors of these syntheses have failed to account for several primary drivers of biodiversity change, have relied on data poor time-series that lack baselines needed to detect change, and have unreasonably extrapolated conclusions. Here we summarize the history of this debate, as well as key papers and exchanges that have helped clarify new issues and ideas. To resolve the debate, we suggest future researchers be more clear about the hypotheses of biodiversity change being tested, focus less on amassing large datasets, and more on amassing high-quality datasets that provide unambiguous tests of the hypotheses. Researchers should also keep track of the contributions that native versus non-native species make to biodiversity time trends, as these have different implications for conservation. Lastly, we suggest researchers be aware of pros and cons of using different types of data (e.g., time-series, spatial comparisons), taking care to resolve divergent results among sources to allow broader conclusions about biodiversity change.},

abstract = {Climate change disrupts ecological systems in many ways. Many documented responses depend on species' life histories, contributing to the view that climate change effects are important but difficult to characterize generally. However, systematic variation in metabolic effects of temperature across trophic levels suggests that warming may lead to predictable shifts in food web structure and productivity. We experimentally tested the effects of warming on food web structure and productivity under two resource supply scenarios. Consistent with predictions based on universal metabolic responses to temperature, we found that warming strengthened consumer control of primary production when resources were augmented. Warming shifted food web structure and reduced total biomass despite increases in primary productivity in a marine food web. In contrast, at lower resource levels, food web production was constrained at all temperatures. These results demonstrate that small temperature changes could dramatically shift food web dynamics and provide a general, species-independent mechanism for ecological response to environmental temperature change.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}Ocean acidification is a pervasive stressor that could affect many marine organisms and cause profound ecological shifts. A variety of biological responses to ocean acidification have been measured across a range of taxa, but this information exists as case studies and has not been synthesized into meaningful comparisons amongst response variables and functional groups. We used meta-analytic techniques to explore the biological responses to ocean acidification, and found negative effects on survival, calcification, growth and reproduction. However, there was significant variation in the sensitivity of marine organisms. Calcifying organisms generally exhibited larger negative responses than non-calcifying organisms across numerous response variables, with the exception of crustaceans, which calcify but were not negatively affected. Calcification responses varied significantly amongst organisms using different mineral forms of calcium carbonate. Organisms using one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate (high-magnesium calcite) can be more resilient to ocean acidification than less soluble forms (calcite and aragonite). Additionally, there was variation in the sensitivities of different developmental stages, but this variation was dependent on the taxonomic group. Our analyses suggest that the biological effects of ocean acidification are generally large and negative, but the variation in sensitivity amongst organisms has important implications for ecosystem responses.},

Coastal marine systems may be usefully considered as metacommunities in which propagules are exchanged among components, and in which the persistence of one species depends on that of others.Our results suggest that the large-scale distribution of marine species can be dynamic and can result from local ecological processes.We discuss the potential implications of these findings for marine reserve design and the need for long-term monitoring programs to validate predictions from metacommunity models.

abstract = {Seascape genetics, a term coined in 2006, is a fast growing area of population genetics that draws on ecology, oceanography and geography to address challenges in basic understanding of mar- ine connectivity and applications to management. We provide an accessible overview of the latest develop- ments in seascape genetics that merge exciting new ideas from the field of marine population connectivity with statistical and technical advances in population genetics. After summarizing the historical context leading to the emergence of seascape genetics, we detail questions and methodological approaches that are evolving the discipline, highlight applications to conservation and management, and conclude with a summary of the field's transition to seascape ge- nomics. From 100 seascape genetic studies, we assess trends in taxonomic and geographic coverage, sam- pling and statistical design, and dominant seascape drivers. Notably, temperature, oceanography and geo - graphy show equal prevalence of influence on spatial genetic patterns, and tests of over 20 other seascape factors suggest that a variety of forces impact connec- tivity at distinct spatio-temporal scales. A new level of rigor in statistical analysis is critical for disentangling multiple drivers and spurious effects. Coupled with GIS data and genomic scale sequencing methods, this rigor is taking seascape genetics beyond an initial focus on identifying correlations to hypothesis-driven insights into patterns and processes of population connectivity and adaptation. The latest studies are illuminating differences between demographic, func- tional and neutral genetic connectivity, and informing applications to marine reserve design, fisheries sci- ence and strategies to assess resilience to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts.},

abstract = {Aim  Assessing the spatial structure and dynamics of marine populations is still a major challenge in ecology. The need to manage marine resources from ecosystem and large-scale perspectives is recognized, but our partial understanding of oceanic connectivity limits the implementation of globally pertinent conservation planning. Based on a biophysical model for the entire Mediterranean Sea, this study takes an ecosystem approach to connectivity and provides a systematic characterization of broad-scale larval dispersal patterns. It builds on our knowledge of population dynamics and discusses the ecological and management implications.   Location  The semi-enclosed Mediterranean Sea and its marine ecosystems are used as a case study to investigate broad-scale connectivity patterns and to relate them to oceanography and population dynamics.   Methods  A flow network is constructed by evenly subdividing the basin into sub-regions which are interconnected through the transport of larvae by ocean currents. It allows for the computation of various connectivity metrics required to evaluate larval retention and exchange.   Results  Our basin-scale model predicts that retention processes are weak in the open ocean while they are significant in the coastal ocean and are favoured along certain coastlines due to specific oceanographic features. Moreover, we show that wind-driven divergent (convergent, respectively) oceanic regions are systematically characterized by larval sources (sinks, respectively). Finally, although these connectivity metrics have often been studied separately in the literature, we demonstrate they are interrelated under particular conditions. Their integrated analysis facilitates the appraisal of population dynamics, informing both genetic and demographic connectivities.   Main conclusions  This modelling framework helps ecologists and geneticists to formulate improved hypotheses of population structures and gene flow patterns and to design their sampling strategy accordingly. It is also useful in the implementation and assessment of future protection strategies, such as coastal and offshore marine reserves, by accounting for large-scale dispersal patterns, a missing component of current ecosystem management.},

Focusing on larval dispersal by ocean currents, we propose an approach coupling Lagrangian transport and new tools from Network Theory to characterize marine connectivity in the Mediterranean basin. Larvae of different pelagic durations and seasons are modeled as passive tracers advected in a simulated oceanic surface flow from which a network of connected areas is constructed. Hydrodynamical provinces extracted from this network are delimited by frontiers which match multi-scale oceanographic features. By examining the repeated occurrence of such boundaries, we identify the spatial scales and geographic structures that would control larval dispersal across the entire seascape. Based on these hydrodynamical units, we study novel connectivity metrics for existing reserves. Our results are discussed in the context of ocean biogeography and MPAs design, having ecological and managerial implications.},

abstract = {One of the most pervasive forms of uncertainty in data used to make conservation decisions is error associated with mapping of conservation features. Whilst conservation planners should consider uncertainty associated with ecological data to make informed decisions, mapping error is rarely, if ever, accommodated in the planning process. Here, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization approach that accounts for the uncertainty inherent in coral reef habitat maps and apply it in the Kubulau District fisheries management area, Fiji. We use accuracy information describing the probability of occurrence of each habitat type, derived from remote sensing data validated by field surveys, to design a marine reserve network that has a high probability of protecting a fixed percentage (10-90{\%}) of every habitat type. We compare the outcomes of our approach to those of standard reserve design approaches, where habitat-mapping errors are not known or ignored. We show that the locations of priority areas change between the standard and probabilistic approaches, with errors of omission and commission likely to occur if reserve design does not accommodate mapping accuracy. Although consideration of habitat mapping accuracy leads to bigger reserve networks, they are unlikely to miss habitat conservation targets. We explore the trade-off between conservation feature representation and reserve network area, with smaller reserve networks possible if we give up on trying to meet targets for habitats mapped with a low accuracy. The approach can be used with any habitat type at any scale to inform more robust and defensible conservation decisions in marine or terrestrial environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We tested this theory in the marine environment by comparing the diversity and abundance of fish and macroinvertebrates associated with small and large seagrass beds. In natural beds, several small beds had significantly more species than a single large bed. This occurred because a large proportion of species were not shared among beds. However, results of experiments using artificial seagrass beds to manipulate size of beds were equivocal. More species and more individuals were found in several small beds on only few occasions in experimental treatments. These results contradicted the patterns found in comparisons among natural beds. Our results stress the need to experimentally validate theories for reserve design and also indicate the danger of directly applying land-based principles to marine communities without critically examining them for each habitat.},

abstract = {In marine ecosystems, fishing often targets predators, which can drive direct and indirect effects on entire food webs. Marine reserves can induce trophic cascades by increasing predator density and body size, thereby increasing predation pressure on populations of herbivores, such as sea urchins. In California's northern Channel Islands, two species of sea urchins are abundant: the red urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus , which is targeted by an economically valuable fishery, and the virtually unfished purple urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus . We hypothesized that urchin populations inside marine reserves would be depressed by higher predation, but that red urchins would be less affected due to fishing outside reserves. Instead, our analyses revealed that purple urchin populations were unaffected by reserves, and red urchin biomass significantly increased in response to protection. Therefore, urchin biomass overall has increased inside reserves, and we found no evidence that giant kelp is positively affected by reserves. Our results reveal the overwhelming direct effect of protecting fished species in marine reserves over indirect effects that are often predicted but seldom clearly documented. Indirect effects due to marine reserves may eventually occur in some cases, but very effective predators, large reserves or extended time periods may be needed to induce them.},

Because fishing reduces the density of fish (reducing transmission efficiency of directly transmitted parasites), selectively removes large fish (which tend to carry more parasites than small fish), and reduces food web complexity (reducing transmission efficiency of trophically transmitted parasites), the removal of fish from the world's oceans over the course of hundreds of years may be driving a longterm, global decline in fish parasites. There has been growing recognition in recent years that parasites are a critical part of biodiversity and that their loss could substantially alter ecosystem function. Such a loss may be among the last major ecological effects of industrial fishing to be recognized by scientists.},

We show how sustainability depends on the fraction of natural larval settlement (FNLS) remaining after reserves are implemented, which in turn depends on reserve configuration and larval dispersal distance. Sustainability requires FNLS to be greater than an empirically determined minimum, Maintaining an adequate value for all species requires either a large, unlikely fraction ({\textgreater} 35{\%}) of coastline in reserves, or reserves that are larger than the mean larval dispersal distance of the target species. FNLS is greater for species dispersing shorter distances, which implies reserves can lead to: (1) changes in community composition and (2) genetic selection fur shorter dispersal distance. Dependence of sustainability on dispersal distance is a new source of uncertainty.},

Glass sponges are usually found in deep water ({{\textgreater}}1000 m) worldwide but form kilometre-long reefs on the continental shelf of British Columbia and Alaska that are under threat from trawling and resource exploration. Due to their deep-water habitat, larvae have not yet been found and the level of genetic connectivity between reefs and nonreef communities is unknown. The genetic structure of Aphrocallistes vastus, the primary reef-building species in the Strait of Georgia (SoG) British Columbia, was studied using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pairwise comparisons of multilocus genotypes were used to assess whether sexual reproduction is common. Structure was examined 1) between individuals in reefs, 2) between reefs and 3) between sites in and outside the SoG. Sixty-seven SNPs were genotyped in 91 samples from areas in and around the SoG, including four sponge reefs and nearby nonreef sites. The results show that sponge reefs are formed through sexual reproduction. Within a reef and across the SoG basin, the genetic distance between individuals does not vary with geographic distance (r = −0.005 to 0.014), but populations within the SoG basin are genetically distinct from populations in Barkley Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Population structure was seen across all sample sites (global FST = 0.248), especially between SoG and non-SoG locations (average pairwise FST = 0.251). Our results suggest that genetic mixing occurs across sponge reefs via larvae that disperse widely.},

abstract = {As the most widespread seagrass in temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, Zostera marina provides a unique opportunity to investigate the extent to which the historical legacy of the last glacial maximum (LGM18 000-10 000 years bp) is detectable in modern population genetic structure. We used sequences from the nuclear rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplast matK-intron, and nine microsatellite loci to survey 49 populations ({\textgreater} 2000 individuals) from throughout the species' range. Minimal sequence variation between Pacific and Atlantic populations combined with biogeographical groupings derived from the microsatellite data, suggest that the trans-Arctic connection is currently open. The east Pacific and west Atlantic are more connected than either is to the east Atlantic. Allelic richness was almost two-fold higher in the Pacific. Populations from putative Atlantic refugia now represent the southern edges of the distribution and are not genetically diverse. Unexpectedly, the highest allelic diversity was observed in the North Sea-Wadden Sea-southwest Baltic region. Except for the Mediterranean and Black Seas, significant isolation-by-distance was found from {\~{}}150 to 5000 km. A transition from weak to strong isolation-by-distance occurred at {\~{}}150 km among northern European populations suggesting this scale as the natural limit for dispersal within the metapopulation. Links between historical and contemporary processes are discussed in terms of the projected effects of climate change on coastal marine plants. The identification of a high genetic diversity hotspot in Northern Europe provides a basis for restoration decisions.},

abstract = {This paper estimates the overall nitrogenous nutrient budget for the Puget Sound/Strait of Georgia/Juan de Fuca Strait estuarine ecosystem, and the potential for eutrophication of this system by anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Large-scale eutrophication is unlikely for two reasons. First, ambient nitrate+ammonia concentrations are high (2-20 $\mu$M N) over much of the total area, so that total primary productivity is relatively insensitive to moderate increases or decreases. Second, exchange of water by estuarine and tidal currents is rapid (c. I year turnover time), and entering water carries naturally high nutrient concentrations. Natural nitrogen inputs by the estuarine circulation are very much larger than all other sources combined: 2600-2900 tonnes N day-1 for the entire system and 1400-1500 tonnes N day-1 for the inner basins (Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound) vs. {\textless} 100 tonnes N day-1 for sewage inputs, {\textless} 160 tonnes N day-1 for river inputs plus sewage, {\textless} 15 tonnes N day-1 for coastal groundwater discharge exclusive of sewage, and {\textless} 10 tonnes N day-1 for atmospheric inputs. The largest loss terms for nutrients are also due to estuarine exchange. Surface-layer advective export of dissolved inorganic nitrogen is 2100-2400 tonnes N day-1 through Juan de Fuca Strait and about 1000 tonnes N day-1 from the inner basins. Advective export of organic nitrogen can be estimated only roughly, but is probably between 100 and 300 tonnes N day-1 as dissolved organics, and 100-200 tonnes N day-1 as living and detrital particulates. Due to the dominant role of estuarine exchange, the overall nutrient budget is likely to be strongly affected by variations in river discharge (affecting total flow) and offshore oceanographic conditions (affecting nutrient content of incoming deep water). Sensitivity to nutrient addition varies with location. The least sensitive sub-regions are the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the tidally-mixed passages linking it to Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia. The most sensitive sub-regions are some tributary inlets and fjords that have low flushing rates and that adjoin urbanized shorelines.},

abstract = {During the last 20 years, ecologists discovered the importance of including spatial relationships in models of species distributions. Among the latest developments in modelling how species are spatially structured are eigenfunction-based spatial filtering methods such as Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) and principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM). Although these methods are very powerful and flexible, they are only suited to study distributions resulting from non-directional spatial processes. The asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) framework, a new eigenfunction-based spatial filtering method, fills this theoretical gap. AEM was specifically designed to model spatial structures hypothesized to be produced by directional spatial processes. Water currents, prevailing wind on mountainsides, river networks, and glaciations at historical time scales are some of the situations where AEM can be used. This paper presents three applications of the method illustrating different combinations of: sampling schemes (regular and irregular), data types (univariate and multivariate), and spatial scales (metres, kilometres, and hundreds of kilometres). The applications include the distribution of a crustacean (Atya) in a river, bacterial production in a lake, and the distribution of the copepodite stages of a crustacean on the Atlantic oceanic shelf. In each application, a comparison is made between AEM, MEM, and PCNM. No environmental components were included in the comparisons. AEM was a strong predictor in all cases, explaining 59. 8{\%} for Atya distribution, 51. 4{\%} of the bacterial production variation, and 38. 4{\%} for the copepodite distributions. AEM outperformed MEM and PCNM in these applications, offering a powerful and more appropriate tool for spatial modelling of species distributions under directional forcing and leading to a better understanding of the processes at work in these systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org.. British Ecological Society is collaborating with JSTOR to digitize, preserve and extend access to Journal of Animal Ecology. Summary 1. Conservation biology has two threads: the small-population paradigm which deals with the effect of smallness on the persistence of a population, and the declining-population paradigm which deals with the cause of smallness and its cure. 2. The processes relevant to the small-population paradigm are amenable to theoretical examination because they generalize across species and are subsumed by an inclusive higher category: stochasticity. 3. In contrast, the processes relevant to the declining-population paradigm are essentially humdrum, being not one but many. So far they have defied tight generalization and hence are of scant theoretical interest. 4. The small-population paradigm has not yet contributed significantly to conserving endangered species in the wild because it treats an effect (smallness) as if it were a cause. It provides an answer only to a trivial question: how long will the population persist if nothing unusual happens? Rather, its major contribution has been to captive breeding and to the design of reserve systems. 5. The declining-population paradigm, on the other hand, is that relevant to most problems of conservation. It summons an investigation to discover the cause of the decline and to prescribe its antidote. Hence, at least at our current level of understanding , it evokes only an ecological investigation which, although utilizing the rigour of tight hypotheses and careful experimentation, is essentially a one-off study of little theoretical interest. 6. The principal contribution of the small-population paradigm is the theoretical underpinning that it imparted to conservation biology, even though most of that theory presently bears tenuous relevance to the specific problems of aiding a species in trouble. It would contribute immeasurably more if some of the theoretical momentum so generated were channelled into providing a theory of driven population declines, thereby liberating the declining-population paradigm from the inefficiency of case-by-case ecological investigations and recovery operations. 7. The declining-population paradigm is urgently in need of more theory. The small-population paradigm needs more practice. Each has much to learn from the other. A cautious intermixing of the two might well lead to a reduction in the rate at which species are presently going extinct.},

From a meta-analysis, we suggest that the spatial scale of marine connectivity is underestimated due to the limited geographic extent of sampling designs. We also found that the largest marine reserves ({\textgreater}1000 km 2 ) are the most isolated. These findings have important implications for the assessment of evolutionary, ecological, and socio-economic long-distance benefits of marine reserves.

Incorporating long-distance connectivity in conservation planning will contribute to increase the benefits of marine reserve networks.},

abstract = {Abstract Planktonic marine invertebrate embryos and larvae lead transitory lives of great risk and grave uncertainty. Estimation of the magnitude of risk and mortality, however presents a formidable challenge. Three methods are currently in use to estimate levels of mortality among populations of marine invertebrate larvae: 1) theoretical models where rates of instantaneous mortality are correlated with other life history parameters, 2) estimation of mortality based on laboratory observations of predator-prey interactions and 3) analysis of relationships among gamete production, larval populations, and densities of post-larvae in the field. Theoretical exercises indicate that rates of larval mortality are correlated with duration of the planktonic period, and that differences in mortality rates may be offset by differences in egg size and fecundity. Results from laboratory investigations suggest that mortality rates change with larval size or age. Attempts to monitor cohorts of larvae in the plankton offer the most direct evidence for natural mortality, although they often lack confidence that larvae were sampled from a continuous population. Because factors that contribute to the mortality of marine invertebrate embryos and larvae operate concurrently and mortality is a density-dependent and age-specific demographic process, detailed investigations of several synergistic ecological parameters are required to provide meaningful estimates of instantaneous mortality rates in larval populations.},

Epiphyte biomass and areal productivity were not significantly reduced, however. The dominant epiphyte grazer (Lacuna spp.) increased in biomass. For several of the parameters measured, seasonal pattern as well as mean value changed significantly from one year to the next.

We used a numerical approach to investigate whether these processes could be affected by species-specific differences in larval vertical swimming behavior of 2 oyster species (Crassostrea vir- ginica and C. ariakensis) in Chesapeake Bay, a partially mixed estuary. A coupled particle-tracking and hydrodynamic model was forced with observed winds and freshwater flow and included the best available estimate of present-day oyster habitat. Model scenarios were conducted with hydrody- namic predictions from June to September, 1995 to 1999, to simulate a range of environmental con- ditions. Simple larval swimming behaviors were parameterized for the 2 oyster species with results from preliminary laboratory experiments and literature. To isolate the effect of circulation, settlement habitat, and larval behavior on the spatial trajectories of particles, vertical swimming velocity was the only biological process represented in the model; egg production and larval growth were not included. Differences in larval swimming behavior had significant consequences for particle trans- port in Chesapeake Bay by influencing dispersal distances, transport success, and the degree of con- nectivity between ‘subpopulations' in different tributaries. Most particles ({\textgreater}96{\%}) did not return to the same reef on which they were released, and there were behavior-dependent differences in spa- tial patterns of the ‘source' and ‘sink' characteristics of oyster reefs. Simulated larval behavior had greater influence on spatial patterns of transport success than did interannual differences in circula- tion patterns. These model results have implications for fisheries management and oyster restoration activities. KEY},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biol- ogy, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) envi- ronmental changes in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Metacommunity ecology recognizes the interplay between local and regional patterns in contributing to spatial variation in community structure. In aquatic systems, the relative importance of such patterns depends mainly on the potential connectivity of the specific system. Thus, connectivity is expected to increase in relation to the degree of water movement, and to depend on the specific traits of the study organism. We examined the role of environmental and spatial factors in structuring benthic communities from a highly connected shallow beach network using a metacommunity approach. Both factors contributed to a varying degree to the structure of the local communities suggesting that environmental filters and dispersal-related mechanisms played key roles in determining abundance patterns. We categorized benthic taxa according to their dispersal mode (passive vs. active) and habitat specialization (generalist vs. specialist) to understand the relative importance of environment and dispersal related processes for shallow beach metacommunities. Passive dispersers were predicted by a combination of environmental and spatial factors, whereas active dispersers were not spatially structured and responded only to local environmental factors. Generalists were predicted primarily by spatial factors, while specialists were only predicted by local environmental factors. The results suggest that the role of the spatial component in metacommunity organization is greater in open coastal waters, such as shallow beaches, compared to less-connected environmentally controlled aquatic systems. Our results also reveal a strong environmental role in structuring the benthic metacommunity of shallow beaches. Specifically, we highlight the sensitivity of shallow beach macrofauna to environmental factors related to eutrophication proxies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature B.V. Many marine benthic species undergo a pelagic larval stage during which larvae are transported by ocean currents over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. Although metapopulation theory predicts how stochastic dispersal can alter the stability of metapopulations, little is known about how dispersal-related traits such as spawning time and larval duration interact with spatiotemporal connectivity to affect metapopulation growth and stability. We used stochastic models and stage-structured metapopulation dynamics to study the interacting effects of ocean currents and dispersal traits on regional growth and stability. We derived stochastic metapopulation growth and stability, which predict the strong impact of local density regulation on the response of metapopulation to dynamic connectivity: temporal variance, positive (negative) covariance, and negative (positive) autocorrelation in connectivity deflate (inflate) density-independent growth. Yet, stability decreases (increases) with temporal variance and positive (negative) covariance of connectivity. We applied our derived metrics to simulated connectivity along the coast of British Colombia (Canada) over a range of spawning time (ST) and pelagic larval duration (PLD). Our analysis shows strong interactions between statistical components of connectivity, dispersal-related traits, and metapopulation growth and stability. The non-monotonic response of metapopulation stability to PLD was driven by mean of connectivity over short PLDs ({\textless} 36 days), with a decrease in mean connectivity and stability with PLD. Over longer PLDs, temporal variance in connectivity had a dominant effect, with both a decrease in temporal variance of connectivity and an increase stability with PLDs {\textgreater} 36 days. We therefore use a trait-based framework and partitioning the relative importance of spatial and temporal components of stochastic marine dispersal, to inform species response through climate-induced changes in larval transport and in dispersal-related traits.},

Under some conditions, warming should increase top–down control and trophic transfer rates, leading to declines in prey populations. We tested this prediction in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands, an equatorial upwelling region, where water temperatures are highly variable and nutrient availability is thought to control primary production and standing algal biomass. We used grazing assays, field surveys, and a herbivore exclusion experiment to test the hypothesis that grazing rate and algal biomass are, in part, regulated by temperature via the temperature–dependence of herbivory. Grazing rates were greater during the warm season for urchins and other consumers (including fishes, turtles, and iguanas). Field surveys at ten sites over five years found that temperature was strongly negatively related to macroalgal cover. The results of the exclusion experiment indicate that herbivores had a large effect on macroalgal biomass, even during intense upwelling. Our results suggest that in shallow subtidal habitats across the Gal{\'{a}}pagos archipelago, grazing pressure increases with temperature, potentially resulting in reduced algal biomass when upwelling is weak and greater algal biomass when upwelling is strong and water is cold; an alternative explanation for widely observed association between upwelling intensity and algal biomass.},

abstract = {Strong decreases in greenhouse gas emissions are required to meet the reduction trajectory resolved within the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, even these decreases will not avert serious stress and damage to life on Earth, and additional steps are needed to boost the resilience of ecosystems, safeguard their wildlife, and protect their capacity to supply vital goods and services. We discuss how well-managed marine reserves may help marine ecosystems and people adapt to five prominent impacts of climate change: Acidification, sea-level rise, intensification of storms, shifts in species distribution, and decreased productivity and oxygen availability, as well as their cumulative effects. We explore the role of managed ecosystems in mitigating climate change by promoting carbon sequestration and storage and by buffering against uncertainty in management, environmental fluctuations, directional change, and extreme events. We highlight both strengths and limitations and conclude that marine reserves are a viable low-Tech, costeffective adaptation strategy that would yield multiple cobenefits from local to global scales, improving the outlook for the environment and people into the future.},

abstract = {Stressors such as antibiotics, herbicides, and pollutants are becoming increasingly common in the environment. The effects of stressors on populations are typically studied in homogeneous, nonspatial settings. However, most populations in nature are spatially distributed over environmentally heterogeneous landscapes with spatially restricted dispersal. Little is known about the effects of stressors in these more realistic settings. Here, we combine laboratory experiments with novel mathematical theory to rigorously investigate how a stressor's physiological effect and spatial distribution interact with dispersal to influence population dynamics. We prove mathematically that if a stressor increases the death rate and/or simultaneously decreases the population growth rate and yield, a homogeneous distribution of the stressor leads to a lower total population size than if the same amount of the stressor was heterogeneously distributed. We experimentally test this prediction on spatially distributed populations of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We find that the antibiotic cycloheximide increases the yeast death rate but reduces the growth rate and yield. Consistent with our mathematical predictions, we observe that a homogeneous spatial distribution of cycloheximide minimizes the total equilibrium size of experimental metapopulations, with the magnitude of the effect depending predictably on the dispersal rate and the geographic pattern of antibiotic heterogeneity. Our study has implications for assessing the population risk posed by pollutants, antibiotics, and global change and for the rational design of strategies for employing toxins to control pathogens and pests.},

abstract = {Diverse habitats composing coastal seascapes occur in close proximity, connected by the flux of materials and fauna across habitat boundaries. Understanding how seascape connectivity alters important ecosystem functions for fish, however, is not well established. For a seagrass‐dominant seascape, we predicted that configuration and composition of adjacent habitats would alter habitat access for fauna and trophic subsidies, enhancing nursery function for juvenile fish. In an extensive Zostera marina seagrass meadow, we established sites adjacent to (1) highly complex and productive kelp forests (Nereocystis luetkeana), (2) unvegetated sand habitats, and (3) in the seagrass meadow interior. Using SCUBA, we conducted underwater observations of young‐of the‐year (YOY) rockfish (Sebastes spp.) recruitment across sites. Using generalized linear mixed effects models, we assessed the role of seascape adjacency relative to seagrass provisions (habitat complexity and prey) on YOY recruitment. YOY rockfish collections were used to trace sources of allochthonous vs. autochthonous primary production in the seagrass food web, via a $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N isotopic mixing model, and prey consumption using stomach contents. Overall, seagrass nursery function was strongly influenced by adjacent habitats and associated subsidies. Allochthonous N. luetkeana was the greatest source of energy assimilated by YOY rockfish within seagrass sites. In seagrass sites adjacent to N. luetkeana kelp forests, YOYs consumed higher quality prey, which corresponded with better body condition relative to sites adjacent to sand. Moreover, kelp forest adjacency enhanced YOY rockfish recruitment within the seagrass meadow, suggesting that habitat complexity is a key seascape feature influencing the nursery function of nearshore habitats. In general, to promote seascape connectivity, the conservation and restoration of nursery habitats should prioritize the inclusion of habitat mosaics of high structural complexity and productivity. We illustrate and emphasize the importance of using a seascape‐level approach that considers linkages among habitats for the management of important nearshore ecosystem functions.},

abstract = {Trophic structure of ecosystems is a unifying concept in ecology; however, the quantification of trophic level of individual components has not received the attention one might expect. Ecosystem network analysis provides a format to make several assessments of trophic structure of communities, including the effective trophic level (i.e. non-integer) of these components. We applied network analysis to a Halodule wrightii community in Goose Creek Bay, St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, Florida, USA, during January and February 1994 where we sampled a wide variety of taxa. Unlike most applications of network analysis, the field sampling design was specific for network construction. From these data and literature values, we constructed and analyzed one of the most complex, highly articulated and site specific foodweb networks to be done. Care was taken to structure the network to reflect best the field data and ecology of populations within the requirements of analysis software. This involved establishing internally consistent rules of data manipulation and compartment aggregation. Special attention was paid to the microbial components of the food web. Consumer compartments comprised effective trophic levels from 2.0 (herbivore/detritivore) to 4.32 (where a level 4.0 represents 'secondary carnivory'), and these values were used to organize data interpretation. The effective trophic levels of consumers tended to aggregate near integer values, but the spread from integer values increased with increasing level. Detritus and benthic microalgae acted as important sources of food in the extended diets of many consumers. 'Bottom-up' control appeared important through mixed trophic impact analysis, and the extent of positive impacts decreased with increasing trophic level. 'Top-down' control was limited to a few consumers with relatively large production or biomass relative to their trophic position. Overall, ordering results from various network analysis algorithms by effective trophic level proved useful in highlighting the potential influence of different taxa to trophodynamics. Although the calculation of effective trophic level has been available for some time, its application to the evaluation of other analyses has previously not received due consideration.},

abstract = {Research hypotheses have been a cornerstone of science since before Galileo. Many have argued that hypotheses (1) encourage discovery of mechanisms, and (2) reduce bias—both features that should increase transferability and reproducibility. However, we are entering a new era of big data and highly predictive models where some argue the hypothesis is outmoded. We hypothesized that hypothesis use has declined in ecology and evolution since the 1990s, given the substantial advancement of tools further facilitating descriptive, correlative research. Alternatively, hypothesis use may have become more frequent due to the strong recommendation by some journals and funding agencies that submissions have hypothesis statements. Using a detailed literature analysis (N = 268 articles), we found prevalence of hypotheses in eco–evo research is very low (6.7{\%}–26{\%}) and static from 1990–2015, a pattern mirrored in an extensive literature search (N = 302,558 articles). Our literature review also indicates that neither grant success nor citation rates were related to the inclusion of hypotheses, which may provide disincentive for hypothesis formulation. Here, we review common justifications for avoiding hypotheses and present new arguments based on benefits to the individual researcher. We argue that stating multiple alternative hypotheses increases research clarity and precision, and is more likely to address the mechanisms for observed patterns in nature. Although hypotheses are not always necessary, we expect their continued and increased use will help our fields move toward greater understanding, reproducibility, prediction, and effective conservation of nature.},

Here, I show that crustaceans inhabiting fragmented Zostera seagrass meadows show a dramatic response (change in abundance) to patch edges, with 11 out of 12 tests showing greatest abundance at the boundary between sand and seagrass. These patterns occurred on a scale of 0.25-1 m around the patch edge. Changes in seagrass biomass are unlikely to explain this pattern, as seagrass biomass increased smoothly at the patch edge, and did not decline towards patch interiors. In contrast to crustaceans, only a few polychaete taxa responded to the patch edge (9 of 25 tests), and bivalves generally did not show a response (1 of 5 tests). These latter groups are predominantly infaunal, and their lack of response may be partly due to the presence of substantial quantities of seagrass root and rhizome material in the sand habitat, which was defined visually based on the lack of above-ground seagrass components only.},

abstract = {How closely does variability in ecologically important traits reflect evolutionary divergence? The use of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to predict biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning, and more generally the use of phylogenetic information in community ecology, depends in part on the answer to this question. However, comparisons of the predictive power of phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity (FD) have not been conducted across a range of experiments. To address how phylogenetic diversity and functional trait variation control biodiversity effects on biomass production, we summarized the results of 29 grassland plant experiments where both the phylogeny of plant species used in the experiments is well described and where extensive trait data are available. Functional trait variation was only partially related to phylogenetic distances between species, and the resulting FD values therefore correlate only partially with PD. Despite these differences, FD and PD predicted biodiversity effects across all experiments with similar strength, including in subsets that excluded plots with legumes and that focused on fertilization experiments. Two- and three-trait combinations of the five traits used here (leaf nitrogen percentage, height, specific root length, leaf mass per unit area, and nitrogen fixation) resulted in the FD values with the greatest predictive power. Both PD and FD can be valuable predictors of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning, which suggests that a focus on both community trait diversity and evolutionary history can improve understanding of the consequences of biodiversity loss.},

The simulations were conducted using passive particles placed at three depths and vertically migrating particles for 30 or 90 days in late winter. Simulated surface particle dispersion was found to be consistent with winter ocean current observations made from analysis of satellite imagery, current mooring, and drifter data. The GHNMCA would contribute to a network of MPAs because it supplies and receives particles from other MPAs in northern British Columbia. Model simulations also indicate that the greatest source of particles to GHNMCA originate from 30-m and not 2-m flows. Finally, the simulated mean daily dispersal rate of 2.0 km center dot day(-1) would allow fish and invertebrates to self-seed northern portions of the GHNMCA in winter. Together, the GHNMCA and other MPAs appear to contribute a large percentage of particles to non-MPA regions in northern Hecate Strait, which may be considered a particle sink in winter.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Many marine organisms are sedentary as adults and are redistributed between generations by the oceanic transport of planktonic larvae. In order to assess interactions among oceanographic and biological processes that determine larval dispersal patterns, we introduce a Lagrangian (or water-parcel-following) description of larval transport. This formalism is used to determine larval dispersal kernels (larval settlement probability distributions) for a range of ocean flows, planktonic larval durations and settlement pre-competency/competency periods. Paths of individual planktonic larval releases are modeled statistically and, by averaging over many individuals, ensemble estimates of larval dispersal are determined. Typical dispersal scales vary from a few km to {\textgreater}400 km. Modeled dispersal kernels are well explained using only a few readily available biological and oceanographic parameters, and derived dispersal scales agree well with population-genetic estimates, suggesting that the model has reasonable predictive power. An index for regional-scale self-seeding is presented, and is used as a tool to evaluate the efficiency of marine conservation areas. Finally, settlement patterns resulting from larval releases made over short times (days to months) should be comprised of a small number of discrete samples taken from the long-term averaged dispersal kernel. The resulting larval dispersal patterns will be quasi-random in both space and time, which will have important implications for the interpretation of settlement time series and the prediction of recruitment of sessile organisms.},

abstract = {The connectivity of marine organisms among habitat patches has been dominated by two independent paradigms with distinct conservation strategies. One paradigm is the dispersal of larvae on ocean currents, which suggests networks of marine reserves. The other is the demersal migration of animals from nursery to adult habitats, requiring the conservation of connected ecosystem corridors. Here, we suggest that a common driver – wave exposure – links larval and demersal connectivity across the seascape. To study the effect of linked connectivities on fish abundance at reefs, we parameterize a demographic model for The Bahamas seascape using maps of habitats, empirically forced models of wave exposure and spatially realistic 3-dimensional hydrological models of larval dispersal. The integrated empirical-modeling approach enabled us to study linked-connectivity on a scale not currently possible by purely empirical studies. We find sheltered environments not only provide greater nursery habitat for juvenile fish but larvae spawned on adjacent reefs have higher retention, thereby creating a synergistic increase in fish abundance. Uniting connectivity paradigms to consider all life-stages simultaneously can help explain the evolution of nursery habitat use and simplifies conservation advice: reserves in sheltered environments have desirable characteristics for biodiversity conservation and can support local fisheries through adult spillover.},

abstract = {Coral reef fish have considerable larval behavioral capabilities that can lead to successful completion of the early pelagic life phase. In particular, vertical migration during ontogeny increases retention near natal reefs and decreases losses due to transport by currents. For those larvae that are not returning home, the relative influence of behavior (biology) and currents (physics) on their arrival pattern among adjacent and distant reefs is not known. Moreover, interactions of the naturally small-scale larval movements with those of larger-scale currents need to be evaluated with regard to the spatial patterns of recruitment. We used an offline Lagrangian stochastic modeling approach to explore the relative influence of physical (i.e. eddy perturbation, diffusion) and biological processes (i.e. vertical movement, mortality) on the connectivity of the coral reef fish population in the western Caribbean, a region with complex geomorphology and circulation. This study revealed that the impact of larval behavior extends beyond enhancing the process of self-recruitment by changing population connectivity patterns. Connectivity was significantly influenced by larval vertical movement, survival, and by the eddy field, all controlling arrival patterns near reefs. A sensitivity analysis was done to gauge the robustness of the results by varying the model parameters. We found that particle-tracking models with homogeneous parameterization of the sub-grid motion tended to bias dispersal from and along the reef track, which can be mitigated by using spatially explicit parameters calculated from the Eulerian velocity fields. Finally, larval survival emerged as a key component for connectivity estimates, the study of which poses a great challenge in tropical ecosystems.},

abstract = {In benthic invertebrates dispersal of planktotrophic larvae is generally considered more effective than is, for example, the rafting of adults or egg masses. It is certainly true that over short distances, viz., in the range of tens ofkilometres or less, a moderately long-lived planktotrophic larva rep- resents an effective mechanism of dispersal. However, tur- bulent mixing and mortality will decrease the concentra- tion of planktotrophic larvae, and at some distance from the ancestral population the density of settlers may be too low to enable future matings between adults of low mo- bility. On the other hand, adults, juveniles or benthic egg masses drifted over long distances may colonize new habi- tats. The crucial point is the type of larval development of the organism. If the founder group belongs to a species with direct development or which produces very short- lived planktonic larvae, the low mobility of all life-stages will maintain a population within a restricted area so that mates will be likely to encounter each other even in a small population. Even if transport of benthic stages happens very rarely, this may be more influential than larval dis- persal over long distances. To show that this may be true the detailed geographical distribution of two intertidal gas- tropod species with contrasting modes of development is presented and further support from the literature for this hypothesis is discussed.},

abstract = {Connectivity is frequently cited as a vital component of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks and was formally identified as one of five key principles for marine network design in European waters. Yet, without the ability to demonstrate connectivity, it is impossible to be certain that sites designated within a MPA network do in fact constitute a network, when they may –irrespective of the diversity and rarity of the taxa within them– be in reality a set of unlinked habitats and associated species assemblages. However, the process of assessing connectivity between MPAs, and which taxa to include in assessments of connectivity, is often difficult and can be dependent on a variety of factors that can be outside the control of managers, stakeholders and policymakers. Among the many methods that have been used to assess connectivity, genetic markers are often used to infer connectivity indirectly by estimating the degree of genetic differentiation between populations of a species or by inferring the origin(s) of migrants using assignment methods. While modern molecular methods can be extremely robust and are now routinely used to address conservation issues, genetic data are, to the authors' knowledge, rarely used to inform designation of MPA networks. In this paper, several biological and methodological factors are highlighted, consideration of which may help to inform the selection of species for assessments of connectivity between MPAs in a network, and this paper suggests ways in which genetic data may be interpreted to inform MPA design and policy.},

Despite its millennia-long and continued application by Indigenous peoples to environmental management, non-Indigenous “Western” scientific research and management have only recently considered IK. We use detailed and diverse examples to highlight how IK is increasingly incorporated in research programs, enhancing understanding of – and contributing novel insight into – ecology and evolution, as well as physiology and applied ecology (that is, management). The varied contributions of IK stem from long periods of observation, interaction, and experimentation with species, ecosystems, and ecosystem processes. Despite commonalities between IK and science, we outline the ethical duty required by scientists when working with IK holders. Given past and present injustice, respecting self-determination of Indigenous peoples is a necessary condition to support mutually beneficial research processes and outcomes.},

abstract = {Demographic connectivity is fundamental to the persistence and resilience of metapopulations, but our understanding of the link between reproduction and recruitment is notoriously poor in open-coast marine populations. We provide the first evidence of high local retention and limited connectivity among populations spanning 700 km along an open coast in an upwelling system. Using extensive field measurements of fecundity, population size and settlement in concert with a Bayesian inverse modelling approach, we estimated that, on average, Petrolisthes cinctipes larvae disperse only 6.9 km (±25.0 km s.d.) from natal populations, despite spending approximately six weeks in an open-coast system that was once assumed to be broadly dispersive. This estimate differed substantially from our prior dispersal estimate (153.9 km) based on currents and larval duration and behaviour, revealing the importance of employing demographic data in larval dispersal estimates. Based on this estimate, we predict that demographic connectivity occurs predominantly among neighbouring populations less than 30 km apart. Comprehensive studies of larval production, settlement and connectivity are needed to advance an understanding of the ecology and evolution of life in the sea as well as to conserve ecosystems. Our novel approach provides a tractable framework for addressing these questions for species occurring in discrete coastal populations.},

abstract = {Intertidal landscapes are highly complex and dynamic habitats that exhibit variability over a range of spatial and temporal scales. The spatial arrangement of structure-forming biogenic features such as seagrasses and bivalves influences ecosystem function and the provision of important ecosystem services, though quantification and monitoring of intertidal landscape structure has been hindered by challenges collecting spatial data in the coastal zone. In this study, an intertidal landscape mosaic of eelgrass (Zostera marina) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) was observed using low-altitude aerial photography from a balloon-mounted digital camera platform. Imagery representing seagrass-bivalve landscape structure was classified and analysed using multiple metrics of landscape composition and configuration at the patch scale and the landscape scale. Patch-scale imagery was compared to a previously collected dataset in order to track temporal changes in seagrass patch metrics over a 26-month period. Seagrass and bivalve patches exhibited distinct spatial patterning at different spatial scales. At the patch scale, the change in seagrass metrics was consistent with patch border expansion at the expense of patch density and integrity. These methods demonstrate a novel approach for collecting high-resolution spatial data that could also be valuable to physical geographers dealing with similar fine-scale landscapes. The application of spatial metrics at multiple spatial scales quantified elements of the configuration and composition of a seagrass-bivalve habitat mosaic and allowed for the tracking of patch metrics through time to depict landscape change. Continued development of landscape metrics within intertidal habitats will increase understanding of the ecological function of these areas with benefits to management and monitoring of ecosystem health.},

abstract = {Early theories of species diversity proposed that communities at equilibrium are saturated with species. However, experiments in plant communities suggest that many communities are unsaturated and species richness can be increased by adding propagules of new species. We experimentally tested for community saturation and measured the effects of propagule supply on community structure in a benthic marine system. We manipulated propagule supply (arrival of individuals of numerous species) of mobile grazers in experimental mesocosms over multiple generations and, unlike previous tests, we examined the cascading effects of propagule supply on prey (macroalgae) biomass. We found little evidence for saturation, despite the absence of processes such as disturbance and predation that are thought to alleviate saturation in nature. Increasing propagule supply increased the total number of species and made rare species more abundant. Perhaps surprisingly, given the strong effect of propagule supply on species richness, supply-related changes in body size and composition suggest that competitive interactions remained important. Grazer supply also had strong cascading effects on primary production, possibly because of dietary complementarity modified by territorial behavior. Our results indicate that propagule supply can directly influence the diversity and composition of communities of mobile animals. Furthermore, the supply of consumer propagules can have strong indirect effects on prey and fundamental ecosystem properties.},

abstract = {We review the progress made in the emerging field of coastal seascape ecology, i.e. the application of landscape ecology concepts and techniques to the coastal marine environment. Since the early 1990s, the landscape ecology approach has been applied in several coastal subtidal and intertidal biogenic habitats across a range of spatial scales. Emerging evidence indicates that animals in these seascapes respond to the structure of patches and patch mosaics in different ways and at different spatial scales, yet we still know very little about the ecological significance of these relationships and the consequences of change in seascape patterning for ecosystem functioning and overall biodiversity. Ecological interactions that occur within patches and among different types of patches (or seascapes) are likely to be critically important in maintaining primary and secondary production, trophic transfer, biodiversity, coastal protection, and supporting a wealth of ecosystem goods and services. We review faunal responses to patch and seascape structure, including effects of fragmentation on 5 focal habitats: seagrass meadows, salt marshes, coral reefs, mangrove forests, and oyster reefs. Extrapolating and generalizing spatial relationships between ecological patterns and processes across scales remains a significant challenge, and we show that there are major gaps in our understanding of these relationships. Filling these gaps will be crucial for managing and responding to an inevitably changing coastal environment. We show that critical ecological thresholds exist in the structural patterning of biogenic ecosystems that, when exceeded, cause abrupt shifts in the distribution and abundance of organisms. A better understanding of faunal-seascape relationships, including the identifications of threshold effects, is urgently needed to support the development of more effective and holistic management actions in restoration, site prioritization, and forecasting the impacts of environmental change.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a management tool used to respond to human-derived threats in marine ecosystems. Historically, MPAs have been established on an individual ad hoc basis, rather than through a systematic, planned process. However, high levels of functional and spatial connectivity within marine ecosystems have led to the suggestion that networks of MPAs provide greater ecological benefits than individual MPAs. Consequently, international policy has developed to consider broader spatial requirements for marine conservation, resulting in a number of international and regional agreements that require the establishment of ecologically coherent MPA networks. Existing MPAs are now being considered, retrospectively, alongside new designations, as networks of MPAs across regions, both nationally and internationally. Under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), France, the Republic of Ireland, and the UK (including Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man) are required to work together to ensure coordinated development of marine strategies for the Celtic Seas subregion. Accordingly, MPAs have been identified as crucial components of the programme of measures to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) under the MSFD. Here, we provide the first ecological coherence assessment of an MPA network spanning an MSFD subregion. A network of 533 MPAs, or parts thereof, across the Celtic Seas subregion was assessed using five criteria and two methodologies, with a focus on broadscale habitats. While the Celtic Seas MPA network as a whole is not ecologically coherent (according to accepted thresholds), progress toward a number of global targets has been achieved, for example, protection of 10{\%} of marine and coastal areas under the Convention on Biological Diversity. Further, all MSFD predominant habitat types assessed are adequately represented and replicated within the network. However, a number of gaps were identified, including a lack of MPAs in offshore and deeper areas, and inadequate proportions of predominant habitat types within MPAs. Addressing these gaps to enable the MPA network to fulfill its critical role in the delivery of GES under the MSFD will require both national progress toward designation of adequate and viable MPAs and transboundary agreements and coordination of MPA designation processes at the European level.},

However, over half the global protected‐area inventory is composed of protected areas that are {\textless}100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty‐eight taxon‐specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50{\%}) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area‐sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be included in conservation planning.},

Engaging a broad network of researchers worldwide, we used a horizon-scan approach to identify the most important challenges which need to be overcome in order to gain a fuller understanding of migration ecology, and which could be addressed using radar aeroecological and macroecological approaches. The top challenges include both long-standing and novel topics, ranging from fundamental information on migration routes and phenology, orientation and navigation strategies, and the multitude of effects migrants may have on resident communities, to societal challenges, such as protecting or preventing migrant services and disservices, and the conservation of migrants in the face of environmental changes.

abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have led to the biotic homogenization of many ecological communities, yet in coastal systems this phenomenon remains understudied. In particular, activities that locally affect marine habitat‐forming foundation species may perturb habitat and promote species with generalist, opportunistic traits, in turn affecting spatial patterns of biodiversity. Here, we quantified fish diversity in seagrass communities across 89 sites spanning 6° latitude along the Pacific coast of Canada, to test the hypothesis that anthropogenic disturbances homogenize (i.e., lower beta‐diversity) assemblages within coastal ecosystems. We test for patterns of biotic homogenization at sites within different anthropogenic disturbance categories (low, medium, and high) at two spatial scales (within and across regions) using both abundance‐ and incidence‐based beta‐diversity metrics. Our models provide clear evidence that fish communities in high anthropogenic disturbance seagrass areas are homogenized relative to those in low disturbance areas. These results were consistent across within‐region comparisons using abundance‐ and incidence‐based measures of beta‐diversity, and in across‐region comparisons using incidence‐based measures. Physical and biotic characteristics of seagrass meadows also influenced fish beta‐diversity. Biotic habitat characteristics including seagrass biomass and shoot density were more differentiated among high disturbance sites, potentially indicative of a perturbed environment. Indicator species and trait analyses revealed fishes associated with low disturbance sites had characteristics including stenotopy, lower swimming ability, and egg guarding behavior. Our study is the first to show biotic homogenization of fishes across seagrass meadows within areas of relatively high human impact. These results support the importance of targeting conservation efforts in low anthropogenic disturbance areas across land‐ and seascapes, as well as managing anthropogenic impacts in high activity areas.},

abstract = {A marine protected area (MPA) is an area of the ocean designated for the conservation and protection of natural or cultural resources. MPAs are spatial tools used to preserve the ecological integrity and biodiversity of an area, protecting ecosystem functions, species and habitats for future generations. In 2015, the Canadian government committed to increasing protection of its coastal and marine areas up to 10{\%} by 2020. To reach this goal, the Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) is currently in the process of designing and implementing a network of MPAs in the Maritimes Region, on the Atlantic coast of Canada. The design process needs to consider population connectivity, which in turn requires an understanding of life-histories for target species (i.e. the movement of adults and the dispersal of larval life-stages). The population parameters that repeatedly emerge as necessary for deriving estimates of MPA dimensions include the spatial distribution of the conservation priority (species or habitat), movement patterns and oceanographic processes. A decision tree was developed that uses information on species larval dispersal, and juvenile, and adult movement to provide guidelines that can inform definition of size and spacing of individual MPAs in a network. Case studies of species targeted for protection on the Scotian Shelf are presented, to illustrate its use. The decision tree can be used as a tool to help design networks that ensure population connectivity where there is a paucity of biological information, or as a quality control method for assessing other spatial design tools.},

We investigated the abundance of seeds produced and dispersed by the seagrass Zostera marina L. at a protected site within an enclosed bay. We also examined the buoyancy potential of seed dispersal units (diaspores) in the laboratory. Field observations showed that 31{\%} of the total potentially produced seeds were dispersed as decayed reproductive shoots on the sea bottom of the parent bed, whereas 14{\%} were dispersed in spathes (a component of reproductive shoots; seeds are contained inside) detached from live reproductive shoots. However, more than half of the dispersed spathes were negatively buoyant because of the weight of the ripe seeds they contained. Thus, {\textless}6{\%} of potentially produced seeds were dispersed by rafting away from the parent bed. The abundance of ripe seeds dispersed was comparable to that of seeds in the parent bed sediment. The fate of the remaining 54{\%} of total potentially produced seeds was not detected, and they were assumed to be immature or to have been consumed by herbivores. Fewer than 5{\%} of the dispersed seeds had germinated. Our results show that most seeds were dispersed within the parent bed, supporting one of the fitness-related seed-dispersal hypotheses, namely that dispersal mechanisms play a role in bed maintenance and increased genetic diversity.},

We enriched plants of central patches with 15 N, then measured d 15 N in green lynx spiders, the most abundant insect predator, in patches that were either connected to or isolated from the enriched patch. We found that corridors increased prey movement, as they increased spider d 15 N by 40{\%} in connected patches. Corridors also improved spider body condition , increasing nitrogen relative to carbon. We suggest a novel mechanism, trophic subsidies, through which corridors may increase the stability or size of populations in connected landscapes.},

abstract = {1. The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides. These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species. 2. Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3. In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness. 4. Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5. Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems.},

abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexis- tence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantifica- tion shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific inter- actions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are es- sential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coex- istence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover},

abstract = {Question: Population ecology and population genetics are treated separately in most textbooks. However, Darwin's term the 'struggle for existence' included both natural selection and ecological competition. Using the simplest possible mathematical models, this paper searches for historical reasons for the lack of unity in ecological and evolutionary thought. Assumptions and methods: Logistic density-dependent population growth and Lotka-Volterra competition models are used throughout. Derivations of the logistic from first principles of resource use, competition for space, and births and deaths of individuals are documented. A full range of possible kinds of natural selection, including constant selection, density- and frequency-dependent selection, as well as hard and soft selection, can emerge cleanly as natural outcomes from the simplest-imaginable haploid models derived from Lotka-Volterra competition. Extensions to incorporate more realism, including non-linear per capita density dependence, Allee effects, complex life histories, discrete generations, diploid Mendelian genetics, sexual populations, and speciation are briefly discussed. Conclusions: Widespread use of r-K ('carrying capacity') models of population growth appears to have catalysed fundamental discords in ecology, and between ecology and evolution. Verhulst's original polynomial form of the logistic, here termed the r-$\alpha$ model, is both more natural in theory, and accords better with empirical data. The r-$\alpha$ formulation explains apparent paradoxes involving the r-K logistic, including controversial aspects of r- and K-selection. Adoption of first-principles birth-death or r-$\alpha$ modelling clarifies natural selection in density-regulated populations, and leads to an improved understanding of Darwinian evolution and speciation. {\textcopyright} 2012 J.

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an area-based conservation strategy commonly used to safeguard marine biodiversity and ecosystem services. Ecological connectivity governs the exchange of individuals among spatially fragmented habitats and is often highlighted as an important element in the design of MPAs. However, the degree to which measured or modelled representations of connectivity are applied to marine management decisions worldwide remains unclear. We reviewed the scientific and management literature to explore the application of connectivity in MPAs located in six countries or regions with advanced marine spatial planning. Only 11{\%} of the 746 MPAs we examined considered connectivity as an ecological criterion, increasingly so since 2007. Landscape measures such as habitat linkages were used most frequently by managers and genetic and modelling approaches by scientists. Of the MPAs that considered connectivity, 71{\%} were for state marine conservation areas or reserves in California and commonwealth marine reserves in Australia. This pattern indicates substantial geographic bias. We propose that the incorporation of connectivity in conservation planning needs to become more accessible to practitioners and provide four recommendations that together will allow scientists and managers to bridge this gap: 1. determine whether to prioritize connectivity as an ecological criterion, 2. identify the role of an MPA in supporting connectivity, 3. identify the appropriate spatial and temporal scale of connectivity, and 4. improve regional knowledge of connectivity patterns. We also propose a framework to facilitate the communication of metrics and patterns of connectivity between scientists and practitioners to apply the best available information in the design and adaptive management of MPAs and networks of MPAs.},

abstract = {Aim: Widespread coral bleaching, crown-of-thorns seastar outbreaks, and tropical storms all threaten foundational coral species of the Great Barrier Reef, with impacts differing over time and space. Yet, dispersal via larval propagules could aid reef recovery by supplying new settlers and enabling the spread of adaptive variation among regions. Documenting and predicting spatial connections arising from planktonic larval dispersal in marine species, however, remains a formidable challenge. Location: The Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Methods: Contemporary biophysical larval dispersal models were used to predict long-distance multigenerational connections for two common and foundational coral species (Acropora tenuis and Acropora millepora). Spatially extensive genetic surveys allowed us to infer signatures of asymmetric dispersal for these species and evaluate concordance against expectations from biophysical models using coalescent genetic simulations, directions of inferred gene flow, and spatial eigenvector modelling. Results: At long distances, biophysical models predicted a preponderance of north–south connections and genetic results matched these expectations: coalescent genetic simulations rejected an alternative scenario of historical isolation; the strongest signals of inferred gene flow were from north–south; and asymmetric eigenvectors derived from north–south connections in the biophysical models were significantly better predictors of spatial genetic patterns than eigenvectors derived from symmetric null spatial models. Main conclusions: Results are consistent with biophysical dispersal models yielding approximate summaries of past multigenerational gene flow conditioned upon directionality of connections. For A. tenuis and A. millepora, northern and central reefs have been important sources to downstream southern reefs over the recent evolutionary past and should continue to provide southward gene flow. Endemic genetic diversity of southern reefs suggests substantial local recruitment and lack of long-distance gene flow from south to north.},

Flow fields from a numerical circulation model are used to investigate whether these invasions could be due to drift in ocean currents. Particle tracking experiments are performed and probability density functions (PDFs) derived that describe the probability of drifting a given upstream distance in a given drift time. Analysis of these PDFs revealed that for invasions that took 20-40. y to occur, propagule drift in ocean currents could be responsible for the upstream spread, while this was not the case for short timescale invasions ({\textless}10. y).

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

Acknowledging their variability and evolution has allowed us to understand how species adapt in response to their environment. The same traits are also involved in how species alter ecosystems and shape their dynamics and functioning. Some theories, such as the metabolic theory of ecology, ecological stoichiometry or pace-of-life theory, already recognize this junction, but only do so in an implicitly non-spatial context. Meanwhile, for a decade now, it has been argued that ecosystem properties have to be understood at a larger scale using meta-ecosystem theory because source-sink dynamics, community assembly and ecosystem stability are all modified by spatial structure. Here, we argue that some ecosystem properties can be linked to a single life-history trait, dispersal, i.e. the tendency of organisms to live, compete and reproduce away from their birth place. By articulating recent theoretical and empirical studies linking ecosystem functioning and dynamics to species dispersal, we aim to highlight both the known connections between life-history traits and ecosystem properties and the unknown areas, which deserve further empirical and theoretical developments.},

We propose a framework for designing implementation strategies, taking into account three critical planning aspects: processes, inputs, and context. Our review identified sixteen processes, which we broadly grouped into four themes and eight inputs. We illustrate how the framework can be used to inform context-dependent implementation strategies, using the process of 'engagement' as an example.

The purpose of this modelling effort was to investigate the transport pathways of Atlantic menhaden and spot larvae from offshore spawning grounds to estuarine nursery habitats. The coupled circulation and behavioural model demonstrated the importance of along-shelf transport in what is generally thought to be a ‘cross-shelf' problem. Cross-shelf transport was associated with bathymetric features, such as shoals. Both physical (e.g. wind) and biological (e.g. changes in larval behaviour) events were responsible for many of the observed patterns in larval transport. Overall, larval transport was determined by circulation but was modified by larval vertical distributions.},

Biodiversity conservation in landscapes undergoing climate and land-use changes requires designing multi- purpose habitat networks that connect themovements of organisms atmultiple spatial scales. Short-range con- nectivity within habitat networks provides organisms access to spatially distributed resources, reduces local extinctions and increases recolonization of habitat fragments. Long-range connectivity across habitat networks facilitates annual migrations and climate-driven range shifts. 2. We present amethod for identifying amultipurpose network of forest patches that promotes both short- and long-range connectivity. Our method uses both graph-theoretic analyses that quantify network connectedness and circuit-based analyses that quantify network traversability as the basis for identifying spatial conservation priorities on the landscape. 3. We illustrate our approach in the agroecosystem, bordered by the Laurentian and Appalachian mountain ranges, that surrounds themetropolis ofMontreal,Canada.Weestablished forest conservation priorities for the ovenbird, a Neotropical migrant, sensitive to habitat fragmentation that breeds in our study area.All connectiv- ity analyses were based on the same empirically informed resistance surface for ovenbird, but habitat pixels that facilitated short- and long-range connectivity requirements had low spatial correlation. The trade-off between connectivity requirements in the final ranking of conservation priorities showed a pattern of diminishing returns such that beyond a threshold, additional conservation of long-range connectivity had decreased effectiveness on the conservation of short-range connectivity. Highest conservation priority was assigned to a series of stepping stone forest patches across the study area that promote traversability between the bordering mountain ranges and to a collection of small forest fragments scattered throughout the study area that provide connectivitywithin the agroecosystem. 4. Landscape connectivity is important for the ecology and genetics of populations threatened by climate change and habitat fragmentation. Our method has been illustrated as a means to conserve two critical dimensions of connectivity for a single species, but it is designed to incorporate a variety of connectivity requirements for many species.Our approach can be tailored to local, regional and continental conservation initiatives to protect essen- tial speciesmovements that will allow biodiversity to persist in a changing climate.},

Best practices are therefore warranted and their application is increasingly required. This framework, implemented with purpose-built scripts written in the R statistical programming language, has been prepared as both a tool and a set of guidelines and methods for the development of consistent, interpretable, and defensible SDMs to support DFO's contribution to Canada's ocean policies. SDMs were built for twelve benthic species to illustrate the application of the framework, and guide emergency oil spill response planning as part of the Regional Response Plan for the Northern Shelf Bioregion. Three model building methods of increasing complexity were applied using a suite of the best available environmental predictors. Knowledge-based envelope models were produced for all species, and emphasized for those found to be data deficient. These envelope models provided guidance for the development of the subsequent data-driven models, and can be used to help evaluate uncertainty in model predictions. They also provide an avenue for engaging species experts in the process. Data- driven generalized linear (GLM) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models were generated, along with a corresponding ensemble model, for the eight species found to have adequate observational data. The highest quality predictions were generated for those species for which sample sizes were high, and observational data were well-distributed across the study area. All ensemble models performed moderately well (AUC {\textgreater} 0.7) when evaluated using a spatial block cross-validation approach. Thirteen recommendations were conceived as part of the development of the framework and its application. They provide guidance on the application of SDM methods related to data selection and preparation, model development and evaluation, and highlight ways to improve modelling outcomes by applying best-practices where possible. Future development of SDMs for additional species in Pacific Canada will be greatly facilitated by the set of common predictors, methods, and evaluation tools assembled here.},

However, less attention has been directed towards understanding how changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and alongshore currents during this period influenced the geographic distribution of coastal taxa. Here, we examine these effects in northern California, USA, with a focus on the region between Point Reyes and Point Arena. This region represents an important biogeographic transition zone that lies {\textless}150 km north of Monterey Bay, California, where numerous southern species have historically reached their northern (poleward) range limits. We report substantial changes in geographic distributions and/or abundances across a diverse suite of 67 southern species, including an unprecedented number of poleward range extensions (37) and striking increases in the recruitment of owl limpets (Lottia gigantea) and volcano barnacles (Tetraclita rubescens). These ecological responses likely arose through the combined effects of extreme SST, periods of anomalous poleward flow, and the unusually long duration of heatwave events. Prolonged marine heatwaves and enhanced poleward dispersal may play an important role in longer-term shifts in the composition of coastal communities in northern California and other biogeographic transition zones.},

Multiple stressors, including invasive species that directly alter, remove, or replace the foundation plant species, threaten these ecosystems.

However, the interaction of the same co-occurring species on the Pacific coast has not been investigated. We conducted an enclosure experiment in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, to determine if the engineering impacts of green crabs on Pacific eelgrass ecosystems mirror those previously identified on the Atlantic coast. Eelgrass shoot density declined rapidly over 4 weeks, with a 73–81{\%} greater loss in enclosures with high crab density compared to the low-density and control treatments. The low ratio of eelgrass blades to rhizomes in the high-density treatment suggests that blade shredding, rather than bioturbation of whole plants, was the main mechanism of eelgrass loss. Eelgrass was detected in green crab stomach contents, consistent with observations from the Atlantic coast. Crab density did not have a detectable effect on the biomass or community composition of benthic fauna associated with eelgrass over the duration of the experiment. The eelgrass loss we observed was consistent with losses observed on the Atlantic coast, which raises management concerns on the Pacific coast, particularly in areas where green crabs co-occur with other coastal stressors and with ecologically and economically important species such as salmon.},

abstract = {In many marine species, high levels of gene flow ensure that the genetic signal from population differentiation is weak. As a consequence, various errors associated with estimating population genetic parameters that might normally be safely ignored assume a relatively greater importance. This fact has important implications for the use of genetic data to address two common questions in fishery conservation and management: (1) How many stocks of a given species are there? and (2) How much gene flow occurs among stocks? This article discusses strategies to maximize the signal:noise ratio in genetic studies of marine species and suggests a quantitative method to correct for bias due to a common sampling problem. For many marine species, however, genetic methods alone cannot fully resolve these key management questions because the amount of migration necessary to eliminate most genetic evidence of stock structure (only a handful of individuals per generation) will generally be inconsequential as a force for rebuilding depleted populations on a time scale of interest to humans. These limitations emphasize the importance of understanding the biology and life history of the target species - first, to guide design of the sampling program, and second, so that additional information can be used to supplement indirect estimates of migration rates based on genetic data.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Kirk et al. The complexity of host–parasite interactions makes it difficult to predict how host–parasite systems will respond to climate change. In particular, host and parasite traits such as survival and virulence may have distinct temperature dependencies that must be integrated into models of disease dynamics. Using experimental data from Daphnia magna and a microsporidian parasite, we fitted a mechanistic model of the within-host parasite population dynamics. Model parameters comprising host aging and mortality, as well as parasite growth, virulence, and equilibrium abundance, were specified by relationships arising from the metabolic theory of ecology. The model effectively predicts host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across temperature while using less than half the parameters compared to modeling temperatures discretely. Our results serve as a proof of concept that linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host–parasite framework can be used to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level.},

abstract = {Populations of many marine species are only weakly synchronous, despite coupling through larval dispersal and exposure to synchronous environmental drivers. Although this is often attributed to observation noise, factors including local environmental differences, spatially variable dynamics, and chaos might also reduce or eliminate metapopulation synchrony. To differentiate spatially variable dynamics from similar dynamics driven by spatially variable environments, we applied hierarchical delay embedding. A unique output of this approach, the “dynamic correlation,” quantifies similarity in intrinsic dynamics of populations, independently of whether their abundance is correlated through time. We applied these methods to 17 populations of blue crab ( Callinectes sapidus ) along the US Atlantic coast and found that their intrinsic dynamics were broadly similar despite largely independent fluctuations in abundance. The weight of evidence suggests that the latitudinal gradient in temperature, filtered through a unimodal response curve, is sufficient to decouple crab populations. As unimodal thermal performance is ubiquitous in ectotherms, we suggest that this may be a general explanation for the weak synchrony observed at large distances in many marine species, although additional studies are needed to test this hypothesis.},

Here, we use climate velocity trajectories3, together with information on thermal tolerances and habitat preferences, to project changes in global patterns of marine species richness and community composition under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways4 (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Our simple, intuitive approach emphasizes climate connectivity, and enables us to model over 12 times as many species as previous studies5, 6. We find that range expansions prevail over contractions for both RCPs up to 2100, producing a net local increase in richness globally, and temporal changes in composition, driven by the redistribution rather than the loss of diversity. Conversely, widespread invasions homogenize present-day communities across multiple regions. High extirpation rates are expected regionally (for example, Indo-Pacific), particularly under RCP8.5, leading to strong decreases in richness and the anticipated formation of no-analogue communities where invasions are common. The spatial congruence of these patterns with contemporary human impacts7, 8 highlights potential areas of future conservation concern. These results strongly suggest that the millennial stability of current global marine diversity patterns, against which conservation plans are assessed, will change rapidly over the course of the century in response to ocean warming.},

Although individual impacts from coastal development,degraded water quality,and climate change have been documented,there has been no quantitative global assessment of seagrass loss until now. Our comprehensive global assessment of 215 studies found that seagrasses have been disappearing at a rate of 110 km2 yr−1 since 1980 and that 29{\%}of the known areal extent has disappeared since seagrass areas were initially recorded in 1879. Furthermore,rates of decline have accelerated from a median of 0.9{\%}yr−1 before 1940 to 7{\%}yr−1 since 1990.

Ecological redundancy may be key for ecosystem resilience, but there are still many gaps in our understanding of interspecific differences within a functional group, particularly regarding response diversity, that is, whether members of a functional group respond equally or differently to anthropogenic stressors. Herbivores are critical in determining plant community structure and the transfer of energy up the food web. Human disturbances may alter the ecological role of herbivory by modifying the defense strategies of plants and thus the feeding patterns and performance of herbivores. We conducted a suite of experiments to examine the independent and interactive effects of anthropogenic (nutrient and CO2 additions) and natural (simulated herbivory) disturbances on a seagrass and its interaction with two common generalist consumers to understand how multiple disturbances can impact both a foundation species and a key ecological function (herbivory) and to assess the potential existence of response diversity to anthropogenic and natural changes in these systems. While all three disturbances modified seagrass defense traits, there were contrasting responses of herbivores to such plant changes. Both CO2 and nutrient additions influenced herbivore feeding behavior, yet while sea urchins preferred nutrient-enriched seagrass tissue (regardless of other experimental treatments), isopods were deterred by these same plant tissues. In contrast, carbon enrichment deterred sea urchins and attracted isopods, while simulated herbivory only influenced isopod feeding choice. These contrasting responses of herbivores to disturbance-induced changes in seagrass help to better understand the ecological functioning of seagrass ecosystems in the face of human disturbances and may have important implications regarding the resilience and conservation of these threatened ecosystems.},

abstract = {Heat waves, i.e., periods of extremely hot weather, are expected to increase in frequency and duration under climate change. Repeated exposure to thermal stress events such as heat waves can affect population dynamics and even population persistence. Understanding whether recent thermal history bolsters or hinders demographic responses such as survival or growth during heat waves is crucial for predicting population persistence in the face of climate change. We tested for differential mortality following an experimental heat wave in populations of the splash pool copepod, Tigriopus californicus, inhabiting pools that differ in their recent thermal history. We observed differences in survivorship that were correlated with differences in thermal history. Among multiple metrics of thermal history, daily degree-hours (a measure of heat accumulation) best explained heat wave survival such that a higher number of degree-hours resulted in reduced heat wave survival. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that repeated exposure to sublethal temperatures reduces thermal tolerance. Increasing heat wave intensity and duration, or warmer conditions that increase heat accumulation followed by heat waves may negatively impact population persistence by exacerbating the demographic effects of heat waves. The results of this study emphasize the need to integrate mechanistic physiology within the realm of population ecology to bolster the ability to predict population-level responses to climate change.},

These 11 species span the range of life history characteristics of Hawaiian coral reef species and show different spatial and temporal patterns of connectivity as a result. As expected, the longer the pelagic larval duration (PLD), the greater the proportion of larvae that disperse longer distances, but regardless of PLD (3–270 d) most successful dispersal occurs either over short distances within an island ({\textless}30 km) or to adjacent islands (50–125 km). Again, regardless of PLD, around the island of Moloka‘i, connectivity tends to be greatest among sites along the same coastline and exchange between northward, southward, eastward and westward-facing shores is limited. Using a graph-theoretic approach to visualize the data, we highlight that the eastern side of the island tends to show the greatest out-degree and betweenness centrality, which indicate important larval sources and connectivity pathways for the rest of the island. The marine protected area surrounding Kalaupapa National Historical Park emerges as a potential source for between-island larval connections, and the west coast of the Park is one of the few regions on Moloka‘i that acts as a net larval source across all species. Using this IBM and visualization approach reveals patterns of exchange between habitat regions and highlights critical larval sources and multi-generational pathways to indicate priority areas for marine resource managers.},

Here we use a range dynamics model based on metapopulation theory to show that the distributions of 21 dominant trees in eastern North America are out of equilibrium with climate and demonstrate both extinction debt and colonization credit. Moreover, lags are more severe at northern range limits, suggesting that range contraction in response to warming temperatures will outpace expansion.},

In contrast to research on terrestrial seed dispersal, where much attention has focused on localized physical factors affecting dispersal, studies of oceanic propagule dispersal have often emphasized the role of large-scale factors. We link these two perspectives by exploring how propagule dispersal in the ocean is influenced by the “coastal boundary layer” (CBL), a region of reduced velocities near the shoreline that might substantially modify local-scale dispersal. We used a simple simulation model to demonstrate that accounting for the CBL markedly alters transport distances, the widths of dispersal distributions, and the fraction of larvae retained near their sites of origin (self-retention). Median dispersal distances were up to 59{\%} shorter in simulations with a CBL than in those without. Self-retention of larvae increased by up to 3 orders of magnitude in the presence of CBLs, but only minor changes arose in the long-distance tails of the distributions, resulting in asymmetric, non-Gaussian kernels analogous to those quantified for terrestrial seed dispersal. Because successfully settling larvae are commonly those that remain close to shore and interact with the CBL, ignoring this pervasive oceanographic feature will substantially alter predictions of population self-persistence, estimates of connectivity, and outcomes of metapopulation analyses.},

The land-sharing versus land-sparing debate recently stagnated, lacking an in- tegrating perspective in agricultural landscapes as well as consideration of eco- system services. Here, we argue that land-sharing (i.e. wildlife-friendly farming systems) and land-sparing (i.e. separation of high-yielding agriculture and natural habitats) are not mutually exclusive, as both are needed to balance management needs for the multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes. 2. Land-sharing promotes ecosystem services in agricultural settings, thereby allow- ing for environmentally friendly production. Land set aside in protected areas by land-sparing is crucial for conservation of those species that are incompatible with agriculture. 3. Importantly, as species move throughout the landscape and exploit different habitats, increased connectivity between environmentally friendly managed and protected areas is needed to (a) promote spillover of ecosystem service providers from land-sharing/-sparing measures to agricultural production and rescue ser- vice-providing species from extinction in hostile areas, (b) to facilitate immigra- tion and counteract possible extinctions in spared habitats and (c) to conserve response diversity of species communities for ensuring resilience of ecosystem services in changing environments. 4. In conclusion, the successful management of multifunctional landscapes requires the combination of context-specific land-sharing and land-sparing measures within spatially well-connected landscape mosaics, resulting in land-sharing/- sparing connectivity landscapes.

            {\textless}p{\textgreater}Despite increasing recognition that integrating evolutionary theory into conservation decisions can achieve better long‐term outcomes, there has been little progress adapting management strategies. A commonly hypothesized barrier to better integration is poor understanding of evolutionary biology among conservation practitioners. To assess this claim, we surveyed conservation practitioners to determine their understanding of evolutionary concepts. We found that most practitioners had a good understanding of general concepts (evolution and genetic diversity), but a much poorer understanding of other relevant concepts. These findings suggest that knowledge is limiting the ability of conservation practitioners to effectively manage evolutionary processes. Encouragingly, practitioners educated in evolutionary biology and population genetics had a better understanding, suggesting focused training is important. However, better integration of evolutionary theory will require that evolutionary biologists develop a culture of knowledge exchange, actively engaging practitioners to improve management. Otherwise, our findings suggest it is unlikely practitioners will be able to adapt their practices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Foundation species are important components of ecosystems because they provide habitat and ameliorate stressful conditions for residents. Comparisons of congeneric foundation species have mostly been limited to comparisons of native and invasive species, with less attention paid to multiple native species. Surfgrasses (Phyllospadix spp.) are ubiquitous foundation species on the coast of Oregon, USA, protecting resident invertebrates from waves and providing them with access to sandy substrate in an otherwise rocky habitat. Two native surfgrass species, P. scouleri and P. serrulatus, have superficially similar morphological characteristics and co-occur within the same rocky intertidal zones. We investigated whether these native congeneric species function similarly as foundation species by comparing the 2 species' morphology, sediment accretion and associated resident macroinvertebrates at 3 capes that vary in oceanographic conditions. The results show that although the macroinvertebrate abundance was the same between surfgrass species, macroinvertebrate species richness, composition and functional groups varied considerably, with more infauna and deposit feeders found within P. serrulatus. P. serrulatus also had fewer tillers and rhizomes, and lower biomass per given area, but greater sediment accretion than its congener P. scouleri. One notably strong result was the difference in macroinvertebrate abundance among capes, with Cape Perpetua having 2.5–3 times more animals per given area than Capes Foulweather or Blanco. Overall, we conclude that although the 2 co-occurring surfgrass congeners provided functionally different habitat for resident macroinvertebrates, regional oceanographic processes (i.e. upwelling and productivity) may be more influential in determining the overall abundance and productivity of these diverse animal communities.},

abstract = {Canada's Oceans Act (1997) calls for the Integrated Management (IM) of all activities in or affecting estuarine, coastal and marine waters. For Large Ocean Management Areas (LOMAs), it is important to set manageable conservation priorities. Within the Placentia Bay/Grand Banks (PB/GB) LOMA, conservation priorities were identified in several steps, starting with the identification of Valued Ecosystem Components (VECs) associated with the LOMA or significant areas within the LOMA. These VECs were further prioritized based on the level of risk from human activities using a three-phase methodology presented here. Phase I provides a systematic way to identify a unique list of high risk (key) activities or stressors for each VEC. In Phase II, the risk of harm associated with each key activity or stressor is calculated for each VEC, based on a determination of the Magnitude of the Interaction and Sensitivity. In Phase III the cumulative scores are calculated for each VEC by combining the scores for each key activity or stressor, and the VECs are ranked based on the cumulative scores. These cumulative scores are influenced by both the severity of harm (calculated in Phase II) and number of key activities and stressors (identified in Phase I), and the final ranking of the VECs reflects the relative risk of harm from key human activities and stressors.},

abstract = {Most demersal fishes undergo a dispersal phase as larvae, which strongly influences the connectivity among adult populations and, consequently, their genetic structure and replenishment opportunities. Because this phase is difficult to observe directly, it is frequently simulated through numerical models, most of which consider larvae as passive or only vertically migrating. However, in several locations, including the Mediterranean Sea, many species have been shown to swim fast and orient. Here we use a Lagrangian model to study connectivity patterns among three Mediterranean Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and compare simulations in which virtual larvae are passive to simulations in which oriented swimming is implemented. The parameterization of behavior is based on observations for two groups of species of the family Sparidae: species with small larvae (i.e. 9-11 mm), displaying a maximum swimming speed of 6 cm s-1 and a pelagic larval duration of 13-19 days (e.g. Diplodus annularis L., Oblada melanura L.) and species with large larvae (i.e. 14-16 mm), displaying a maximum swimming speed of 10 cm s-1 and a PLD of 28-38 days (e.g. Spondyliosoma cantharus L.). Including larval behavior in the model i) increased the overall proportion of successful settlers, ii) enhanced self-recruitment within the MPAs, but also iii) increased the intensity and iv) widened the export of eggs and larvae (recruitment subsidy) from the MPAs; overall, it significantly changed connectivity patterns. These results highlight the need to gather the observational data that are required to correctly parameterize connectivity models.},

Incorporating warming disturbances into the design of marine protected areas (MPAs) is fundamental to developing appropriate conservation actions that confer coral reef resilience. We propose an MPA design approach that includes spatially-and temporally-varying sea-surface temperature (SST) data, integrating both observed (1985-2009) and projected (2010-2099) time-series. We derived indices of acute (time under reduced ecosystem function following short-term events) and chronic thermal stress (rate of warming) and combined them to delineate thermal-stress regimes. Coral reefs located on the Brazilian coast were used as a case study because they are considered a conservation priority in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. We show that all coral reef areas in Brazil have experienced and are projected to continue to experience chronic warming, while acute events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. We formulated quantitative conservation objectives for regimes of thermal stress. Based on these objectives, we then evaluated if/how they are achieved in existing Brazilian MPAs and identified priority areas where additional protection would reinforce resilience. Our results show that, although the current system of MPAs incorporates locations within some of our thermal-stress regimes, historical and future thermal refugia along the central coast are completely unprotected. Our approach is applicable to other marine ecosystems and adds to previous marine planning for climate change in two ways: (i) by demonstrating how to spatially configure MPAs that meet conservation objectives for warming disturbance using spatially-and temporally-explicit data; and (ii) by strategically allocating different forms of spatial management (MPA types) intended to mitigate warming impacts and also enhance future resistance to climate warming.},

abstract = {Species' response to environmental site conditions and neighborhood interactions are among the important drivers of species' spatial distributions and the resultant interspecies spatial association. The importance of competition to interspecies spatial association can be inferred from a high degree of trait dissimilarity of the associated species, and vice versa for environmental filtering. However, because the importance of environmental filtering and competition in structuring plant communities often vary with spatial scale and with plant life stage, the species' spatial association–trait dissimilarity relationship should vary accordingly. We tested these assumptions in a fully mapped 50-ha subtropical evergreen forest of China, where we assessed the degrees of interspecies spatial associations between adult trees and between saplings at two different spatial scales (10 m versus 40 m) and measured the degrees of trait dissimilarity of the associated species using six traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry-matter content, wood density, wood dry-matter content and maximum height). Consistent across spatial scales and plant life stages, the degree of interspecies spatial association and the degree of overall trait dissimilarity (i.e. all six traits together) were negatively correlated, suggesting that environmental filtering might help assemble functionally similar species in the forest under study. However, when we looked into the spatial association–trait dissimilarity relationship for individual traits, we found that the relationships between interspecies spatial associations and the dissimilarity of wood density and dry-matter content were significant for adults but not for saplings, suggesting the importance of wood traits in species' survival during ontogeny. We conclude that processes shaping interspecies spatial association are spatial scale and plant life stage dependent, and that the distributions of functional traits offer useful insights into the processes underlying community spatial structure.},

abstract = {Although evidence suggests that humans have elevated global extinction rates and lowered global species richness, species richness at scales smaller than the globe can increase, decrease or remain the same. However, the role of spatial scale is rarely considered as a modifier in driving how richness change unfolds. We first observed richness change over nested spatial scales in a simulation model after environmental change that altered rates of colonizations and extinctions. While being dependent on assumptions (e.g. non‐equilibrium versus equilibrium), we generally find that richness change depends on spatial scale (including larger, smaller or hump‐shaped changes in species richness with increasing scale). Using four case studies, we show different forms of scale‐dependent richness change through time. Some show increasing magnitudes of richness change with scale, while others show decreasing magnitudes of richness change with scale; some even show reversals, where richness change switches from negative to positive, or vice versa, across scales. Finally, we collated data from a heterogeneous set of studies of different taxa from small plots to the globe. We found variable results, which although confounded in ways that preclude strong inference, nevertheless suggest scale‐dependence in several taxa. In all, we show that an observation of an increase or decrease, or no change at all, in richness change through time at a single scale cannot be used to infer change at other scales. Instead, understanding how biodiversity is changing in the Anthropocene requires estimates that explicitly incorporate scale‐dependence. This article is protected by copyright.

Rights and access to marine resources and spaces are frequently reallocated through government or private sector initiatives to achieve conservation, management or development objectives with a variety of outcomes for different sectors of society. This paper provides a definition and gives examples of reallocations of marine resources or spaces that might constitute "ocean grabbing". It offers a tentative framework for evaluating whether marine conservation, management or development is ocean grabbing and proposes an agenda for future research. For a reallocation to be considered ocean grabbing, it must: (1) occur by means of inadequate governance, and (2) be implemented using actions that undermine human security and livelihoods, or (3) produce impacts that reduce social-ecological well-being. Future research on ocean grabbing will: document case studies, drivers and consequences; conduct spatial and historical analyses; and investigate solutions. The intent is to stimulate rigorous discussion and promote systematic inquiry into the phenomenon of ocean grabbing.},

USA, to relate the physical setting of seagrass beds, as measured by a wave exposure index (REI), tidal current speed and water depth, to various measures of the sedimentary environment, spatial heterogeneity of sea-grass distribution and measures of seagrass abundance. Seagrass beds in this area form patterns rang-ing from continuous to semi-continuous to widely dispersed, discrete patches across a gradient of increasing hydrodynamic activity. Tidal current speeds, exposure to waves and relative water depths revealed strong correlative evidence that physical processes influenced landscape-scale (50 X 50 m range with 1 m resolution) features of seagrass beds. Some habitat attributes, such as percent cover of seagrasses, seagrass bed perimeter to area ratio, sediment organic content and percent silt-cldy, declined with increasing REJ and current speed. Increased aggregation of these data was observed above and below the 50{\%} seagrass cover value, and, supported by principle components analysis, sig-naled an abrupt transition of environmental setting correlated with this coverage level. The 50{\%} cover value also occurred at current speeds of -25 cm S-', which should be near the initiation of motion cur-rent speed for local sand sediments, and an RE1 of -3 X 10h This coverage is also near to the 59.28{\%} coverage value, previously determined to be where landscape elements join and below which they tend to exist as discrete patches. We hypothesize that a rapid loss of seagrass habitat structural integrity may occur as the habitat fragments, and seagrass landscape elements become isolated, contributing to the observed transition and accompanying data aggregation above and below the -50{\%} coverage level. We discuss the interaction of physical setting, disturbance, landscape contiguity and growth response by these modular plants in the production of the observed landscape patterns across these hydrodynamic gradients.},

Here we devise a framework to facilitate a regionally cohesive set of marine-protected areas driven by national preferences and supported by quantitative conservation prioritization analyses, and illustrate it using the Coral Triangle Initiative. We identify areas important for achieving six objectives to address ecosystem representation, threatened fauna, connectivity and climate change. We expose trade-offs between areas that contribute substantially to several objectives and those meeting one or two objectives extremely well. Hence there are two strategies to guide countries choosing to implement regional goals nationally: multi-objective hotspots and complementary sets of single-objective priorities. This novel framework is applicable to any multilateral or global initiative seeking to apply quantitative information in decision making.},

Measuring MPA efficacy can be challenging, however, particularly when considering responses at the community level. We gathered 36 abundance and 14 biomass data sets on fish assemblages and used meta-analysis to evaluate the ability of 22 distinct community diversity metrics to detect differences in community structure between MPAs and nearby control sites. We also considered the effects of 6 covariates—MPA size and age, MPA size and age interaction, latitude, total species richness, and level of protection—on each metric. Some common metrics, such as species richness and Shannon diversity, did not differ consistently between MPA and control sites, whereas other metrics, such as total abundance and biomass, were consistently different across studies. Metric responses derived from the biomass data sets were more consistent than those based on the abundance data sets, suggesting that community-level biomass differs more predictably than abundance between MPA and control sites. Covariate analyses indicated that level of protection, latitude, MPA size, and the interaction between MPA size and age affect metric performance. These results highlight a handful of metrics, several of which are little known, that could be used to meet the increasing demand for community-level indicators of MPA effectiveness.

abstract = {Larval dispersal by ocean currents is a critical component of systematic marine protected area (MPA) design. However, there is a lack of quantitative methods to incorporate larval dispersal in support of increasingly diverse management objectives, including local population persistence under multiple types of threats (primarily focused on larval retention within and dispersal between protected locations) and benefits to unprotected populations and fisheries (primarily focused on larval export from protected locations to fishing grounds). Here, we present a flexible MPA design approach that can reconcile multiple such potentially conflicting management objectives by balancing various associated treatments of larval dispersal information. We demonstrate our approach based on alternative dispersal patterns, combinations of threats to populations, management objectives, and two different optimization strategies (site vs. network-based). Our outcomes highlight a consistently high efficiency in selecting priority locations that are self-replenishing, inter-connected, and/or important larval sources. We find that the opportunity to balance these three dispersal attributes flexibly can help not only to prevent meta-population collapse, but also to ensure effective fisheries recovery, with average increases in the number of recruits at fishing grounds at least two-times higher than achieved by standard habitat-based or ad-hoc MPA designs. Future applications of our MPA design approach should therefore be encouraged, specifically where management tools other than MPAs are not feasible. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Sponges link the microbial loop with benthic communities by feeding on bacteria. Glass sponge reefs on the continental shelf of western Canada have extremely high grazing rates, consuming seven times more particulate carbon than can be supplied by vertical flux alone. Unlike many sponges, the reef building species Aphrocallistes vastus has no microbial symbionts and removes little dissolved organic carbon. To determine how reef sponges therefore get enough food to sustain such substantial grazing we measured stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures of water, sediment and sponge tissues. To ensure samples were temporally associated, we also studied the duration particles were retained in tissues in controlled feeding studies using microscopic beads and 13C-labeled bacteria. Although fecal pellets were expelled from sponges within 24 hours of feeding, intact bacteria were still found in tissues and sponge tissues retained elevated 13C levels for at least 14 days. These independent lines of evidence suggest that carbon in reef sponge tissues may reflect food consumed from days to weeks earlier. Stable isotope analysis suggests that heterotrophic bacteria ingested by the sponges comes from a confluence of trophic subsidies: from terrestrial and oceanic sources, and also potentially on sediment-borne bacteria resuspended by tidal currents},

This is inade- quate because these realms often interact through processes that form, utilize and maintain interfaces or connections, which are essential for the persistence of some species and ecosystem functions. Wepresent a conceptual framework for systematic conservation prioritization that explicitly accounts for the con- nectivity between the terrestrial, marine, and freshwater realms. We propose a classification of this con- nectivity that encompasses: (1) narrow interfaces, such as riparian strips; (2) broad interfaces, such as estuaries; (3) constrained connections, such as corridors of native vegetation used by amphibians to move between natal ponds and adult habitat; and (4) diffuse connections, such as the movements of ani- mals between breeding and feeding habitats. We use this taxonomy of inter-realm connectivity to describe existing and new spatial conservation prioritization techniques that aim to promote the persis- tence of processes that operate between realms. },

Although the conditions of local and regional coexistence have been well defined in such systems, no study has attempted to provide clear predictions of classical community-wide patterns. Here we provide predictions for species richness, species relative abundances, and community-level functional properties (productivity and space occupation) at the local and regional scales as functions of the proportion of dispersal between communities. Local (alpha) diversity is maximal at an intermediate level of dispersal, whereas between-community (beta) and regional (gamma) diversity decline as dispersal increases because of increased homogenization of the metacommunity. The relationships between local and regional species richness and the species rank abundance distributions are strongly affected by the level of dispersal. Local productivity and space occupation tend to decline as dispersal increases, resulting in either a hump-shaped or a positive relationship between species richness and productivity, depending on the scale considered (local or regional). These effects of dispersal are buffered by decreasing species dispersal success. Our results provide a niche-based alternative to the recent neutral-metacommunity model and have important implications for conservation biology and landscape management.},

abstract = {Phenological dynamics are controlled by environmental factors, disturbance regimes and species interactions that alter growth or mortality risk. Ecosystem engineers can be a key source of disturbance, yet their effects on the phenologies of co-occurring organisms are virtually unexplored. We investigated how the abundance of a dominant ecosystem engineer, spawning sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), alters the emergence phenology of stream insects. In streams with high densities of salmon, peak insect emergence occurred in early July, immediately prior to salmon spawning. By contrast, peak insect emergence in streams with low densities of salmon was weeks later and more protracted. The emergence of specific taxa was also significantly related to salmon density. A common rearing experiment revealed that differences in emergence timing are maintained in the absence of spawning salmon. We hypothesize that these patterns are probably driven by predictable and severe disturbance from nestdigging salmon driving local adaptation and being a trait filter of insect emergence. Thus, salmon regulate the timing and duration of aquatic insect emergence, a cross-ecosystem flux from streams to riparian systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Connectivity conservation is aimed at sustaining animal movements and ecological processes important to ecosystem functioning and the maintenance of biodiversity. However, connectivity conservation plans are typically developed around a single species and rarely empirically evaluated for their relevance to others, thereby limiting our understanding of how connectivity requirements differ across species. We used an omnidirectional application of circuit theory and GPS data from six species to evaluate connectivity at multiple scales for multiple species within the world's largest transfrontier conservation landscape in southern Africa. We evaluated the effects of linear barriers, natural habitat types and anthropogenic land use on movement. We identified multispecies connectivity hotspots as areas where current flow was concentrated or channelled through pinch points. To evaluate surrogate species for connectivity, we evaluated the correspondence among single-species connectivity across the entire landscape and also examined whether a more localized corridor for African savanna elephant Loxodonta africana captured high multispecies connectivity values. Connectivity models revealed many intact areas across the landscape with diffuse current flow, but also evidence that fences, rivers, roads and areas of anthropogenic use acted as strong barriers to movement—particularly in the case of fences, which completely blocked female elephant movement. Tests of correspondence among single-species connectivity models revealed spotted hyaena and African wild dog as the strongest surrogate species of connectivity. Female elephants were found to be the weakest surrogate species of connectivity at the landscape scale. However, focusing within a localized elephant corridor revealed the areas of concentrated or channelled connectivity for most species in our study. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the single-species focus permeating connectivity literature may result in conservation plans that poorly conserve the connectivity needs of co-occurring species. Our study also highlights the importance of testing the efficacy of surrogate species for connectivity at multiple scales. We recommend evaluating multispecies connectivity to prioritize areas for conservation that safeguard the connectivity needs of multiple species of conservation concern.},

abstract = {1. With the possible exception of inarticulate brachiopods, members of the oligomera (brachiopods, ectoprocts, phoronids, hemichordates, echinoderms) do not reacquire a planktotrophic larval phase once it is lost. The feeding larval stages of inarticulate brachiopods, echinoderms, and ectoprocts evolved in the Ordovician at the latest and probably originated much earlier. 2. For functional reasons, larval feeding mechanisms are more readily lost than gained in the oligomera. Loss of obligate larval planktotrophy is accompanied by an extensive loss of larval structures used in feeding. 3. Feeding larvae are unknown from several classes and orders of the oligomera: articulate brachiopods, cyclostome ectoprocts, pterobranch hemichordates, crinoids, phrynophiurid ophiuroids, and dendrochirote holothuroids. Comparison of adult and larval morphology in these and related taxa shows that the ancestors of most of these taxa had a feeding larval stage. 4. Members of the spiralia (annelids, echiuroids, sipunculids, molluscs, entoprocts) probably also lose mechanisms for larval feeding more readily than they are acquired, but new types of feeding free-swimming larval stages have evolved several times in the annelids and at least once each in the sipunculids and molluscs. Gastropods may retain flexibility in reacquiring planktotrophic larvae because encapsulated or lecithotrophic larvae often retain the structures used in feeding. 5. Differences in flexibility in reacquiring a free-swimming feeding larval stage are associated with the original type of larval feeding mechanism, degree of reorganization at metamorphosis, adult structure, and possibly egg capsules with extraembryonic nutritive material. No single explanation can account for all instances of reacquisition of larval planktotrophy. 6. In most phyla eggs range to smaller sizes among species with the original larval feeding mechanism than among species with secondarily acquired larval feeding mechanisms based on formerly juvenile structures. Secondarily acquired larval planktotrophy may not be as effective in permitting reduced egg size and hence greater fecundity.},

abstract = {The resources available for conserving biodiversity are limited, and so protected areas need to be established in places that will achieve objectives for minimal cost. Two of the main algorithms for solving systematic conservation planning problems are Simulated Annealing (SA) and exact integer linear programing (EILP) solvers. Using a case study in BC, Canada, we compare the cost-effectiveness and processing times of SA used in Marxan versus EILP using both commercial and open-source algorithms. Plans for expanding protected area systems based on EILP algorithms were 12–30{\%} cheaper than plans using SA, due to EILP's ability to find optimal solutions as opposed to approximations. The best EILP solver we examined was on average 1,071 times faster than the SA algorithm tested. The performance advantages of EILP solvers were also observed when we aimed for spatially compact solutions by including a boundary penalty. One practical advantage of using EILP over SA is that the analysis does not require calibration, saving even more time. Given the performance of EILP solvers, they can be used to generate conservation plans in real-time during stakeholder meetings and can facilitate rapid sensitivity analysis, and contribute to a more transparent, inclusive, and defensible decision-making process.},

By spring 2012, marine debris began washing ashore along the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada with a wide range of Asian coastal species attached. We used this unique dataset, where the source region, date of dislodgment and landing location are known, to assess the potential for species invasions by transoceanic rafting on marine debris. Location: Northeast Pacific from 20 to 60°N. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Forty‐eight invertebrate and algal species recorded on Japanese tsunami marine debris (JTMD). Methods: We developed maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution models for 48 species recorded on JTMD to predict establishment potential along the Pacific coast from 20 to 60°N. Models were compared within the context of historical marine introductions from Japan to this region to validate the emergence of marine debris as a novel vector for species transfer. Overall, 27{\%} (13 species) landed with debris at locations with suitable environmental conditions for establishment and survival, indicating that these species may be able to establish new populations or introduce greater genetic diversity to already established non‐native populations. A further 21 species have an environmental match to areas where tsunami debris likely landed, but was not extensively sampled. Nearly 100 Japanese marine species previously invaded the northeastern Pacific, demonstrating this region's environmental suitability for rafting Japanese biota. Historical invasions from Japan are highest in California and largely known from bays and harbours. Main conclusions: Marine debris is a novel and growing vector for non‐native species introduction. By utilizing a unique dataset of JTMD species, our predictive models show capacity for new transoceanic invasions and can focus monitoring priorities to detect successful long‐distance dispersal across the world's oceans.},

How can we measure whether an MPA network is ecologically sound? As such, it provides a benchmark that will permit WWF-Canada and others to rigorously and consistently measure progress toward sound MPA networks, and to assess the soundness of draft network designs that may emerge from planning processes. We also hope that this document will be of use in formulating ecological network design principles at the outset of the design process. The criteria are most relevant to regional-scale networks such as those under development in Canadas five priority Large Ocean Management Areas (LOMAs) and other large marine regions. Our focus in this document is on the design of sound, effective MPA networks that can function within broader marine planning approaches, such as marine spatial planning and integrated management. The first part of this document sets out these criteria, drawing on scientific guidance developed by experts in the field and agreed upon through international bodies, in particular the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It reflects up-to-date scientific advice, global best practice, and commitments under international customary law. For each criterion, additional suggestions are made with regard to implementation in the Canadian context. Well-thought-out scientific criteria will be moot without a plan to put MPA networks in place on the water. The second part of this document makes suggestions for the policy and operational aspects of implementing sound networks of MPAs that embody these criteria in Canada. The document has three appendices, intended as tools to support application of the criteria: Appendix I is an example of a set of ecological design principles that can be used at the outset of an MPA network planning process to guide design of an ecologically sound (also referred to in the international literature as ecologically coherent) MPA network. These design principles can be adapted to each region. Appendix II is a tool, in the form of a checklist, to facilitate evaluation of existing or evolving MPA networks. Appendix III contains the guidance on criteria for ecological coherence as adopted by the CBD in early 2008.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Only one study has investigated the combined effect of maternal asthma and obesity on perinatal outcomes; however, it did not consider small-for-gestational age and large-for-gestational age infants. OBJECTIVES To examine the impact of obesity on perinatal outcomes among asthmatic women. METHODS A cohort of 1386 pregnancies from asthmatic women was reconstructed using three of Quebec's administrative databases and a questionnaire. Women were categorized using their prepregnancy body mass index. Underweight, overweight and obese women were compared with normal weight women. The primary outcome was the birth of a small-for-gestational-age infant, defined as a birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and sex. Secondary outcomes were large-for-gestational-age infants (birth weight {\textgreater}90th percentile for gestational age) and preterm birth ({\textless}37 weeks' gestation). Logistic regression models were used to obtain the ORs of having small-for-gestational-age infants, large-for-gestational-age infants and preterm birth as a function of body mass index. RESULTS The proportions of underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese women were 10.8{\%}, 53.3{\%}, 19.7{\%} and 16.2{\%}, respectively. Obese asthmatic women were not found to be significantly more at risk for giving birth to small-for-gestational-age infants (OR 0.6 [95{\%} CI 0.4 to 1.1]), large-for-gestational-age infants (OR 1.2 [95{\%} CI 0.7 to 2.2]) or having a preterm delivery (OR 0.7 [95{\%} CI 0.4 to 1.3]) than normal-weight asthmatic women. CONCLUSIONS No significant negative interaction between maternal asthma and obesity on adverse perinatal outcomes was observed.},

abstract = {Climate may act on the dispersal and connectivity of marine populations through changes in the oceanic circulation and temperature, and by modifying species' prey and predator distributions. As dispersal and connectivity remain difficult to assess in situ, a first step in studying the effects of climate change can be achieved using biophysical models. To date, only a few biophysical models have been used for this purpose. Here we review these studies and also include results from other recent modelling efforts. We show that increased sea temperature, a major change expected under climate warming, may impact dispersal and connectivity patterns via changes in reproductive phenology (e.g., shift in the spawning season), transport (e.g., reduced pelagic larval duration under faster development rates), mortality (e.g., changes in the exposure to lethal temperatures), and behaviour (e.g., increased larval swimming speed). Projected changes in circulation are also shown to have large effects on the simulated dispersal and connectivity patterns. Although these biophysical modelling studies are useful preliminary approaches to project the potential effects of climate change, we highlight their current limitations and discuss the way forward, in particular the need for adequate coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical simulations using atmospheric forcing from realistic climate change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Connectivity among marine populations is critical for persistence of metapopulations, coping with climate change, and determining the geographic distribution of species. The influence of pelagic larval duration (PLD) on connectivity has been studied extensively, but relatively little is known about the influence of other biological parameters, such as the survival and behavior of larvae, and the fecundity of adults, on population connectivity. Furthermore, the interaction between the seascape (habitat structure and currents) and these biological parameters is unclear. We explore these interactions using a biophysical model of larval dispersal across the Indo-Pacific. We describe an approach that quantifies geographic patterns of connectivity from demographically relevant to evolutionarily significant levels across a range of species. We predict that at least 95{\%} of larval settlement occurs within 155 km of the source population and within 13 days irrespective of the species' life history, yet long-distant connections remain likely. Self-recruitment is primarily driven by the local oceanography, larval mortality, and the larval precompetency period, whereas broad-scale connectivity is strongly influenced by reproductive output (abundance and fecundity of adults) and the length of PLD. The networks we have created are geographically explicit models of marine connectivity that define dispersal corridors, barriers, and the emergent structure of marine populations. These models provide hypotheses for empirical testing.},

abstract = {I present dispersal distances for 44 species with data on propagule duration (PD) for 40 of these. Data were combined with those in Shanks et al. (2003; Ecol. Appl. 13: S159-S169), providing information on 67 species. PD and dispersal distance are correlated, but with many exceptions. The distribution of dispersal distances was bimodal. Many species with PDs longer than 1 day dispersed less than 1 km, while others dispersed tens to hundreds of kilometers. Organisms with short dispersal distances were pelagic briefly or remained close to the bottom while pelagic. Null models of passively dispersing propagules adequately predict dispersal distance for organisms with short PDs ({\textless}1 day), but overestimate dispersal distances for those with longer PDs. These models predict that propagules are transported tens of kilometers offshore; however, many types remain within the coastal boundary layer where currents are slower and more variable, leading to lower than predicted dispersal. At short PDs, dispersal distances estimated from genetic data are similar to observed. At long PDs, genetic data generally overestimate dispersal distance. This discrepancy is probably due to the effect of rare individuals that disperse long distances, thus smoothing genetic differences between populations. Larval behavior and species' life-history traits can play a critical role in determining dispersal distance.},

abstract = {Climate change is having multiple impacts on marine species characterized by sedentary adult and pelagic larval phases, from increasing adult mortality to changes in larval duration and ocean currents. Recent studies have shown impacts of climate change on species persistence through direct effects on individual survival and development, but few have considered the indirect effects mediated by ocean currents and species traits such as pelagic larval duration. We used a density-dependent and stochastic metapopulation model to predict how changes in adult mortality and dynamic connectivity can affect marine metapopulation stability. We analyzed our model with connectivity data simulated from a biophysical ocean model of the northeast Pacific coast forced under current (1998–2007) and future (2068–2077) climate scenarios in combination with scenarios of increasing adult mortality and decreasing larval duration. Our results predict that changes of ocean currents and larval duration mediated by climate change interact in complex and opposing directions to shape local mortality and metapopulation connectivity with synergistic effects on regional metapopulation stability: while species with short larval duration are most sensitive to temperature-driven reduction in larval duration, the response of species with longer larval duration are mostly mediated by changes in both the mean and variance of larval connectivity driven by ocean currents. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the spatiotemporal structure of connectivity in order to predict how the multiple effects of climate change will impact marine populations.},

But drawing such conclusions assumes that the objects of identity—parties—are fixed. If we instead allow party brands to change over time, then partisan instability is consistent with a social-identity To demonstrate conception of partisanship. this, I develop a branding model of partisanship in which voters learn about party brands by observing party behavior over time and base their psychological attachment to a party on these brands. The model suggests that convergence by rival parties, making their brands less distinguishable, should weaken party attachments. I test this implication using a survey experiment in Argentina and find evidence consistent with the model.},

Connectivity is a crucial process underpinning the persistence, recovery, and productivity of marine ecosystems. The Convention on Biological Diversity, through the Aichi Target 11, has set the ambitious objective of implementing a 'well connected system of protected areas' by 2020. 2. This paper identifies eight challenges toward the integration of connectivity into MPA network management and planning. A summary table lists the main recommendations in terms of method, tool, advice, or action to address each of these challenges. Authors belong to a science–management continuum including researchers, international NGO officers, and national MPA agency members. 3. Three knowledge challenges are addressed: selecting and integrating connectivity measurement metrics; assessing the accuracy and uncertainty of connectivity measurements; and communicating and visualizing connectivity measurements. 4. Three management challenges are described: integrating connectivity into the planning and management of MPA networks; setting quantitative connectivity targets; and implementing connectivity-based management across scales and marine jurisdictions. 5. Finally, two paths toward a better integration of connectivity science with MPA management are proposed: setting management-driven priorities for connectivity research, bridging connectivity science, and MPA network management. 6. There is no single method to integrate connectivity into marine spatial planning. Rather, an array of methods can be assembled according to the MPA network objectives, budget, available skills, data, and timeframe. 7. Overall, setting up 'boundary organizations' should be promoted to organize complex cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral and cross-jurisdiction interactions that are needed between scientists, managers, stakeholders and decision-makers to make informed decision regarding connectivity-based MPA planning and management.},

In a region as large and complex as Puget Sound, locating areas to restore eelgrass effectively and efficiently is a challenge. We developed a set of tools to identify and test potential restoration sites, as well as to identify stressors affecting eelgrass and other barriers to its recovery. These tools consist of numerical models of hydrodynamics and eelgrass biomass; a spatially explicit habitat suitability model that incorporates information from predictive models as well as current and past eelgrass cover, substrate, and stressors; information elicited from shoreline planners and seagrass experts; test plantings and monitoring of light, temperature, and survival; and maps and recommendations summarizing all of these components to aid in identifying potential restoration sites. Our habitat suitability model identified 3,000 ha of highly suitable potential habitat where eelgrass is not currently present and an additional 4,401 ha of moderately suitable eelgrass habitat. Surveys of stakeholders identified dredging/filling, shoreline development, water quality, and commercial aquaculture as the most significant stressors on eelgrass, and noted that new regulations and improved enforcement of existing regulations would be necessary to ensure continued recovery and protection of eelgrass. Test plantings at several locations in south Puget Sound (i.e., Joemma State Park and Zangle Cove) suggested the possibility of successful restoration. Test plantings at Anderson Island, Liberty Bay, and the head of Westcott Bay were unsuccessful, which suggested that further investment in restoration at those locations would be unadvisable unless stressors were identified and abated. Overall, we found that our approach provides a foundation for identifying and testing potential restoration sites as well as identifying information needs and potential management actions toward reducing stressors and increasing eelgrass cover and health to meet the challenging restoration goal.},

Results revealed that vegetated bottoms supported substantially larger numbers of decapods, but not fishes, than unvegetated substrates. The lower Bay grassbed was an important nursery area for juvenile blue crabs, although neither of the grassbeds functioned as a nursery for commercially or recreationally valuable fishes. Our results suggest that: (1) further decreases in lower Bay Seagrass biomass would result in reduced numbers of adult blue crabs, but should not substantially affect populations of valuable fish species; (2) additional decreases in Upper Bay submerged vegetation should not produce dramatic change in the population sizes of either adult blue crabs or fishes. {\textcopyright} 1984, Estuarine Research Federation.

Such places are broadly of two kinds: those where the emphasis is put on the protection of the natural world (even though this very often requires working with local people), and those where the focus is on maintaining a relationship between people and nature. It is this second idea – that of people and nature together – which is at the heart of the Protected Landscape approach; or, to use the language of IUCN's protected area categorisation, Category V. Though there is currently a concentration of Protected Landscapes in Europe, they are to be found in every region of the world: in developed and developing countries, in small island States and continental countries. Many more areas, particularly in the developing world, have the potential to be recognised as Protected Landscapes, because they are rich in natural and cultural values and can be models of sustainability. With the rapid loss or modification of natural (or near-natural) ecosystems, it becomes ever more necessary to protect, or restore, other areas that are important for biodiversity conservation. In pursuit of sustainable approaches to development, therefore, countries need to look beyond those relatively limited, if vitally important areas in need of strict protection, and include also in their protected area systems lived-in landscapes that are important for economic, social, cultural and environmental reasons. In particular, they should consider using the Category V model as a way to recognise and encourage the sustainable use of natural resources in places that have been shaped by people over long periods of time, and to support human communities that have adopted sustainable practices.},

The important role of spatial structure in ecology and management is now commonly recognized, and recent advances in marine remote sensing technology have facilitated the application of spatial pattern metrics to the marine environment. However, it is not yet clear whether concepts, metrics, and statistical techniques developed for terrestrial ecosystems are relevant for marine species and seascapes. To address this gap in our knowledge, we reviewed, synthesized, and evaluated the utility and application of spatial pattern metrics in the marine science literature over the past 30 yr (1980 to 2010). In total, 23 studies characterized seascape structure, of which 17 quantified spatial patterns using a 2-dimensional patch-mosaic model and 5 used a continuously varying 3-dimensional surface model. Most seascape studies followed terrestrial-based studies in their search for ecological patterns and applied or modified existing metrics. Only 1 truly unique metric was found (hydrodynamic aperture applied to Pacific atolls). While there are still relatively few studies using spatial pattern metrics in the marine environment, they have suffered from similar misuse as reported for terrestrial studies, such as the lack of a priori considerations or the problem of collinearity between metrics. Spatial pattern metrics offer great potential for ecological research and environmental management in marine systems, and future studies should focus on (1) the dynamic boundary between the land and sea; (2) quantifying 3-dimensional spatial patterns; and (3) assessing and monitoring seascape change. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

The local community is an epiphenomenon that has relatively little explanatory power in ecology and evolutionary biology. Local coexistence cannot provide insight into the ecogeographic distributions of species within a region, from which local assemblages of species derive, nor can local communities be used to test hypotheses concerning the origin, maintenance, and regulation of species richness, either locally or regionally.

We screened 1372, and measured features of 214, reefs throughout Australia's Great Barrier Reef using high-resolution satellite imagery, combined with remote underwater videography and assays on a subset, to quantify the prevalence, size and potential causes of 'grazing halos'. Halos are known to be seascape-scale footprints of herbivory and other ecological interactions. Here we show that these halo-like footprints are more prevalent in reserves, particularly older ones (approx. 40 years old), resulting in predictable changes to reef habitat at scales visible from space. While the direct mechanisms for this pattern are relatively clear, the indirect mechanisms remain untested. By combining remote sensing and behavioural ecology, our findings demonstrate that reserves can shape large-scale habitat structure by altering herbivores' functional importance, suggesting that reserves may have greater value in restoring ecosystems than previously appreciated. Additionally, our results show that we can now detect macro-patterns in reef species interactions using freely available satellite imagery. Low-cost, ecosystem-level observation tools will be critical as reserves increase in number and scope; further investigation into whether halos may help seems warranted. Significance statement: Marine reserves are a widely used tool to mitigate fishing impacts on marine ecosystems. Predicting reserves' large-scale effects on habitat structure and ecosystem functioning is a major challenge, however, because these effects unfold over longer and larger scales than most ecological studies. We use a unique approach merging remote sensing and behavioural ecology to detect ecosystem change within reserves in Australia's vast Great Barrier Reef. We find evidence of changes in reefs' algal habitat structure occurring over large spatial (thousands of kilometres) and temporal (40þ years) scales, demonstrating that reserves can alter her-bivory and habitat structure in predictable ways. This approach demonstrates that we can now detect aspects of reefs' ecological responses to protection even in remote and inaccessible reefs globally.},

abstract = {A diminutive, non-native damselfish (Neopomacentrus cyanomos) was recently discovered inhabiting coral reefs near Veracruz, Mexico—far removed from where it is native in the Red Sea and the Indo-Pacific. The quantities found in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) suggest that the fish has already established a self-sustaining population in this new ecosystem. There is understandable concern, therefore, that this new arrival may become invasive and spread, yet the invasion risk imposed by this fish has not been assessed. In this study, a computer model was employed to deliver a forecast of the potential range of incursion of N. cyanomos in the GOM spanning 5 years. The model incorporated oceanic water flow in the region, tolerances of this damselfish to the ocean environment, and their reproductive strategy in order to supply a temporal and spatial forecast of their spread. From this study, targeted early detection and removal of the fish can be directed if the fish is deemed a threat to native fauna. On the basis of this work, it is foreseeable that the reefs presently harboring N. cyanomos will likely see increased abundance of this damsel. Immediate attempts to eliminate the fish, therefore, should be focused in nearshore shallow waters spanning Veracruz to Frontera, Mexico. Further, water flows in the southern GOM are not widely conducive to long-distance transport of marine organisms with pelagic larvae, reducing the risk of this damsel permeating the greater GOM over 5 years. Aside from N. cyanomos, this study implicitly adds to mounting evidence supporting a biogeographic disconnect between the Veracruz reef complex and the greater GOM and the Caribbean.},

Unlike algae, it is a rooted plant and it traps, accumulates and stores car-bon in the sediments where it grows. In the nearshore zone, distribution of eelgrass habitats can vary from vast flats and beds, to patchy areas or narrow fringe habitats along the shoreline. Eelgrass habitat provides a wide array of eco-logical functions in coastal ecosystems, including essential habitat for commercially and recreationally important in-vertebrate and fish species and baffling the coastline from storms by decreasing currents and wave action. Eelgrass beds also filter runoff and suspended sediments, taking up and storing nutrients and carbon from both water and the sediments in which they are rooted. Finally, eelgrass habitat plays a vital role in facilitating the accumulation of organic matter in sediments, ultimately acting as a carbon sink.},

abstract = {Despite the recognised effectiveness of networks of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as a biodiversity conservation instrument, nowadays MPA network design frequently disregards the importance of connectivity patterns. In the case of sedentary marine populations, connectivity stems not only from the stochastic nature of the physical environment that affects early-life stages dispersal, but also from the spawning stock attributes that affect the reproductive output (e.g., passive eggs and larvae) and its survivorship. Early-life stages are virtually impossible to track in the ocean. Therefore, numerical ocean current simulations coupled to egg and larval Lagrangian transport models remain the most common approach for the assessment of marine larval connectivity. Inferred larval connectivity may be different depending on the type of connectivity considered; consequently, the prioritisation of sites for marine populations' conservation might also differ. Here, we introduce a framework for evaluating and designing MPA networks based on the identification of connectivity hotspots using graph theoretic analysis. We use as a case of study a network of open-access areas and MPAs, off Mallorca Island (Spain), and test its effectiveness for the protection of the painted comber Serranus scriba. Outputs from network analysis are used to: (1) identify critical areas for improving overall larval connectivity; (2) assess the impact of species' biological parameters in network connectivity; and (3) explore alternative MPA configurations to improve average network connectivity. Results demonstrate the potential of graph theory to identify non-trivial egg/larval dispersal patterns and emerging collective properties of the MPA network which are relevant for increasing protection efficiency.},

abstract = {Cumulative impact assessment (CIA) is a promising approach to guide marine spatial planning (MSP) and management. One limitation of CIA is the neglect of seascape connectivity, which may spread the impact of localized pressures to ambient areas, e.g. through lost dispersal and recruitment of organisms. We here, for the first time, incorporate seascape connectivity into a traditional CIA model using a connectivity matrix, exemplified by dispersal of propagules estimated through biophysical modelling. Two connectivity impacts are identified: the source impact represents downstream areas losing recruits because of reduced larval dispersal from sites affected by the pressure, and the sink impact represents loss of recruits originating from upstream areas prevented from settlement in the site affected by the local pressure. By including seascape connectivity in the Swedish MSP-guiding CIA tool Symphony we demonstrate how to practically account for remote effects of local environmental impact. Our example on blue mussel shows how reducing mussel fitness in a given area may have impacts on mussels far from the acting pressures. Overall, results indicate that connectivity impact for blue mussels plays a minor role in most areas, {\textless}10{\%} of the ordinary cumulative impact. However, in some smaller areas, e.g. on offshore banks and the Danish Straits, seascape connectivity may increase ordinary cumulative impact with 20{\%}–30{\%}. In an example of scenario-based CIA analyses of MSP projections, we demonstrate how impacts of particular management actions, e.g. shipping rerouting and wind power developments, can be tracked far from the original area of influence. Depending on the dispersal ability of ecosystem components, a local pressure may impact a considerable area through seascape connectivity, transgressing management units and national borders. Although the mean connectivity impact may be modest for a single ecosystem component, the consideration of seascape connectivity across multiple ecosystem components may significantly alter the mapping of cumulative impact and the assessment of different MSP scenarios. Synthesis and applications. Our extension of Cumulative Impact Assessment offers a new method for mapping and practically integrating seascape connectivity with ecosystem-based MSP and other spatial instruments for policy making, such as marine protected areas.},

Relationships between range dynamics and intrinsic species traits may be particularly apparent in the ocean, where temperature more directly shapes species' distributions. Here, we test for a role of species traits and climate velocity in driving range extensions in the ocean-warming hotspot of southeast Australia. Climate velocity explained some variation in range shifts, however, including species traits more than doubled the variation explained. Swimming ability, omnivory and latitudinal range size all had positive relationships with range extension rate, supporting hypotheses that increased dispersal capacity and ecological generalism promote extensions. We find independent support for the hypothesis that species with narrow latitudinal ranges are limited by factors other than climate. Our findings suggest that small-ranging species are in double jeopardy, with limited ability to escape warming and greater intrinsic vulnerability to stochastic disturbances. Copyright},

We propose a conceptual framework for including the likely impacts of a changing climate on marine connectivity, and synthesize information on the relationships between changing ocean temperature and acidification, connectivity and conservation tools. Our framework relies on concepts of functional connectivity, which depends on an organism's biological and behavioral responses to the physical environment, and structural connectivity, which describes changes in the physical and spatial structure of the environment that affect connectivity and movement. Our review confirms that ocean climate change likely reduces potential dispersal distance and therefore functional connectivity. Structural connectivity in the ocean will inevitably change with the spatial arrangement of biogenic habitats resulting from disturbance as well as enhanced growth and mortality due to climate change. Climate change will also likely reduce the spatial scale of connectivity, suggesting that we will need more closely spaced protected areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 Gerber et al.},

The biophysical model was run over a period of 3 months, from Jul to Sep, representing the period when larvae of the targeted species were present, and at each of 3 years. Overall, release site had the strongest effect of all factors on the dispersal metrics. Although less important than release site in our system, vertical distribution and swim speed had a significant effect which would likely be more pronounced in high (i.e. with features such as estuarine circulation or internal waves) than low energy environments. Retention and distance from shore were more responsive to our manipulations than dispersal distance, both in terms of the number of ecologically significant effects and the magnitudes of their effect size. These findings allow for the prioritization of biophysical model parameters and improved simulations of larval dispersal.},

abstract = {While the physical dimensions of climate change are now routinely assessed through multimodel intercomparisons, projected impacts on the global ocean ecosystem generally rely on individual models with a specific set of assumptions. To address these single-model limitations, we present standardized ensemble projections from six global marine ecosystem models forced with two Earth system models and four emission scenarios with and without fishing. We derive average biomass trends and associated uncertainties across the marine food web. Without fishing, mean global animal biomass decreased by 5{\%} (±4{\%} SD) under low emissions and 17{\%} (±11{\%} SD) under high emissions by 2100, with an average 5{\%} decline for every 1 °C of warming. Projected biomass declines were primarily driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production, and were more pronounced at higher trophic levels, a process known as trophic amplification. Fishing did not substantially alter the effects of climate change. Considerable regional variation featured strong biomass increases at high latitudes and decreases at middle to low latitudes, with good model agreement on the direction of change but variable magnitude. Uncertainties due to variations in marine ecosystem and Earth system models were similar. Ensemble projections performed well compared with empirical data, emphasizing the benefits of multimodel inference to project future outcomes. Our results indicate that global ocean animal biomass consistently declines with climate change, and that these impacts are amplified at higher trophic levels. Next steps for model development include dynamic scenarios of fishing, cumulative human impacts, and the effects of management measures on future ocean biomass trends.},

Some broadcast spawners exhibit genetic panmixia, others show genetic structure similar to direct-developing species, suggesting complex recruitment patterns in rocky shore environments. Patterns of genetic structure do not correspond with pelagic larval competency period, with a broadcast spawning urchin displaying the highest levels of population structure. Biophysicalmodels of larval dispersal revealmixed dispersal patterns, with the strongest connections in a northward direction following the Benguela Current, yet most modeled species also show the capacity for southward (albeit weaker) migration among some sample localities. Some sites, particularly the most northern areas, show very low levels of potential connectivity.

abstract = {We need to understand joint ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change to predict future threats to biological diversity. The ‘evolving metacommunity' framework emphasizes that interactions between ecological and evolutionary mechanisms at both local and regional scales will drive community dynamics during climate change. Theory suggests that ecological and evolutionary dynamics often interact to produce outcomes different from those predicted based on either mechanism alone. We highlight two of these dynamics: (i) species interactions prevent adaptation of nonresident species to new niches and (ii) resident species adapt to changing climates and thereby prevent colonization by nonresident species. The rate of environmental change, level of genetic variation, source-sink structure, and dispersal rates mediate between these potential outcomes. Future models should evaluate multiple species, species interactions other than competition, and multiple traits. Future experiments should manipulate factors such as genetic variation and dispersal to determine their joint effects on responses to climate change. Currently, we know much more about how climates will change across the globe than about how species will respond to these changes despite the profound effects these changes will have on global biological diversity. Integrating evolving metacommunity perspectives into climate change biology should produce more accurate predictions about future changes to species distributions and extinction threats.},

Variation partitioning was conducted to explain the environmental heterogeneity and spatial arrangement of local communities (i.e.,degree of variation in the community) for each functional group. Processes determining community structure and metacommunity type differed among the functional groups. The SA group was under greater influence of environmental control, whereas the fractions of $\beta$-diversity in the DF and BF groups were explained by only spatial predictors. Thus, even if macroinvertebrate communities live in the same ecosystem, different mechanisms may determine the functional community structure, which depends on ecological traits such as dispersal ability and microhabitat. Ecological processes underlying community assembly differ among functional groups, indicating that the existence and/or dynamics of seagrass patches may affect the variation of faunal functions in an ecosystem.},

This knowledge gap is exemplified in temperate estuaries by salmon—ecologically and commercially important species that use estuaries during their migrations to and from the ocean. Here, we tested for species-specific habitat use by sampling fishes in 3 interconnected estuarine habitats (brackish marsh, eelgrass, and sand flat), across seasons and temperature regimes. We quantified fish species richness, community distinctness, and catches (of Chinook and chum salmon, other migratory fishes, and resident fishes) in the Pacific Northwest's heavily urbanized Fraser River estuary, the terminus of what was once the world's most productive salmon basin. Overall, eelgrass habitat supported the greatest fish species richness (n = 37) and catches (37402 fish), exceeding that of both the marsh (19 species, 7154 fish) and sand flat (22 species, 6697 fish). However, the majority of salmon were caught in the marsh (61{\%}). These differences, coupled with our finding that at least one unique fish species inhabited each habitat (eelgrass = 15, marsh = 8, sand flat = 1), demonstrate species-specific habitat use and underscore the importance of connected seascapes for biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {Connections are important: in studying nature, technology, commerce and the social sciences, it often makes sense to focus on the pattern of interactions between individual components. Furthermore, improvements in computing power have made it possible to gather, store and analyze large data sets across many disciplines, and it is apparent that universal features may exist across seemingly disparate application areas. Network Science is the emerging field concerned with the study of large, realistic networks. This interdisciplinary endeavor, focusing on the patterns of interactions that arise between individual components of natural and engineered systems, has been applied to data sets from activities as diverse as high-throughput biological experiments, online trading information, smart-meter utility supplies, and pervasive telecommunications and surveillance technologies. This unique text/reference provides a fascinating insight into the state of the art in network science, highlighting the commonality across very different areas of application and the ways in which each area can be advanced by injecting ideas and techniques from another. The book includes contributions from an international selection of experts, providing viewpoints from a broad range of disciplines. It emphasizes networks that arise in nature - such as food webs, protein interactions, gene expression, and neural connections - and in technology - such as finance, airline transport, urban development and global trade.},

abstract = {Protected area systems need to conserve species in places with suitable habitat that are configured to facilitate gene flow. Since genetic data require considerable resources to obtain, many proxy methods have been developed to generate plans for protected area systems (prioritizations) that facilitate gene flow without needing genetic data. However, the effectiveness of such methods—such as minimising fragmentation or enforcing contiguity among priority areas—remains largely untested. We investigated the ability of prioritizations to maintain gene flow when they are generated using conventional methods for promoting connectivity. Using existing environmental, genetic, and occurrence datasets, we created maps of habitat suitability and resistance to gene flow for nine alpine plant species. Next, we generated multispecies prioritizations that secured 10{\%} of the suitable habitat for each species and attempted to maintain gene flow by (a) penalizing fragmentation, (b) representing species in contiguous areas of suitable habitat, and (c) representing species in contiguous areas with minimal resistance to gene flow as modelled from genetic data. We found that prioritizations generated using fragmentation penalties failed to represent seven of the nine species in areas that would maintain high levels of gene flow. Similarly, prioritizations that represented species in contiguous areas of suitable habitat were unable to maintain high levels of gene flow for six species—potentially because a few areas with high resistance can disrupt gene flow throughout an entire prioritization. Although prioritizations generated using genetic data successfully maintained gene flow, they also selected over three times more land than other prioritizations, suggesting that failing to account for gene flow when setting priorities may underestimate the scale of conservation action required. Synthesis and applications. We found that conventional methods for enhancing connectivity in conservation planning, such as spatially clustering priority areas or providing connected sections of suitable habitat, were generally unable to maintain high levels of gene flow. Our results suggest that conservation plans could be substantially improved by directly using genetic data, although whether this is a good choice for a particular situation will also depend on the costs of obtaining these data.},

abstract = {Dispersal influences ecological dynamics, evolution, biogeography, and biodiversity conservation, but models of larval dispersal in marine organisms make simplifying assumptions that are likely to approximate poorly the temporal dynamics of larval survival and capacity for settlement. In particular, larval mortality rates are typically assumed to be constant throughout larval life; and all larvae are frequently assumed to acquire and lose competence at the same time. To improve upon these assumptions, we here develop simple models of dispersal potential that incorporate rates of mortality, and acquisition and loss of settlement competence. We fit these models to empirical competence and survival data for five scleractinian coral species, to test the models' ability to characterize empirical survival and competence patterns, and to estimate the dispersal potential implied by those patterns. The models fit the data well, incorporating qualitative features of competence and survival that traditional approaches to modeling dispersal do not, with important implications for dispersal potential. Most notably, there was high within-cohort variation in the duration of the competent period in all species, and this variation increases both self-recruitment and long-distance dispersal compared with models assuming a fixed competent period. These findings help to explain the seeming paradox of high genetic population structure, coupled with large geographic range size, observed in many coral species. More broadly, our approach offers a way to parsimoniously account for variation in competence dynamics in dispersal models, a phenomenon that our results suggest has important effects on patterns of connectivity in marine metapopulations.},

Most recent literature has focused on evaluating the role of predation in structuring seagrass faunal communities; however, habitat complexity, abundance of food and sediment stability may also be important. This paper summarizes studies relating predator-prey relationships to different features of the seagrass system. This review suggests that the abundance of many species, both epifauna and infauna, is positively correlated with two distinct aspects of plant morphology: 1) the root-rhizome mat, and 2) the plant canopy. A scheme was developed that defines the conditions under which any particular species will be abundant or rare in a seagrass assemblage. This scheme is based on prey and predator characteristics (e.g., epifaunal vs. infaunal, tube-dweller vs. nontube dweller, burrowers vs. nonburrowers, and large vs. small as adult) and on characteristics of the seagrasses (e.g., leaf morphology, shoot density, shoot biomass, structural complexity of the meadow, and root-rhizome density and standing crop). {\textcopyright} 1984 Estuarine Research Federation.},

To date, these marine studies have predominantly focused on rudimentary metrics describing the spatial and environmental context of their study region (e.g., geographical distance, average sea surface temperature, average salinity). We contend that a more nuanced and considered approach to quantifying seascape dynamics and patterns can strengthen population genomic investigations and help identify spatial, temporal, and environmental factors associated with differing selective regimes or demographic histories. Nevertheless, approaches for quantifying marine landscapes are complicated. Characteristic features of the marine environment, including pe-lagic living in flowing water (experienced by most marine taxa at some point in their life cycle), re-quire a well-designed spatial-temporal sampling strategy and analysis. Many genetic summary statistics used to describe populations may be inappropriate for marine species with large population sizes, large species ranges, stochastic recruitment, and asymmetrical gene flow. Finally, statistical approaches for testing associations between seascapes and population genomic patterns are still maturing with no single approach able to capture all relevant considerations. None of these issues are completely unique to marine systems and therefore similar issues and solutions will be shared for many organisms regardless of habitat. Here, we outline goals and spatial approaches for land-scape genomics with an emphasis on marine systems and review the growing empirical literature on seascape genomics. We review established tools and approaches and highlight promising new stra-tegies to overcome select issues including a strategy to spatially optimize sampling. Despite the many challenges, we argue that marine systems may be especially well suited for identifying candi-date genomic regions under environmentally mediated selection and that seascape genomic approaches are especially useful for identifying robust locus-by-environment associations.},

abstract = {In coastal areas around the world, the dominant primary producers are benthic macrophytes, including seagrasses and macroalgae, that provide habitat structure and food for diverse and abundant populations and communities, and drive ecosystem processes. Seagrass meadows and macroalgal forests are economically central to coastal human communities, particularly in the developing world, contributing to fisheries yield, storm protection, blue carbon storage, and important cultural values. These services are threatened worldwide by human activities, with substantial areas of seagrass and kelp forests lost over the last half-century. Tracking status and trends in marine macrophyte cover and quality is an emerging priority for ocean and coastal management, but doing so has been challenged by limited coordination across the numerous efforts to monitor macrophytes, which vary widely in goals, methodologies, scales, capacity, governance approaches, and data availability. Here, we present a consensus assessment and recommendations on the current state of and opportunities for advancing global marine macrophyte observations, integrating contributions from a community of researchers with broad geographic and disciplinary expertise. The time is ripe to harmonize marine macrophyte observations by building on existing networks and identifying a core set of common metrics and approaches in sampling design, field measurements, taxonomy, governance, capacity building, and data management. A global macrophyte observation community would then be facilitated by ensuring rigorous documentation, archiving and open-access sharing of protocols and resources at all stages of workflow, from field surveys to data management, and provision of open-access data. Realizing these recommendations will produce more effective, efficient, and responsive observing, a more accurate global picture of change in macrophyte systems, and stronger international capacity for sustaining observations.},

Spatially explicit assessments of the risk to coastal marine habitats from cumulative threats provide an alternative approach by identifying sites that are exposed to multiple anthropogenic threats at broad scales. In this study, qualitative measures of vulnerability were combined with geospatial data to evaluate the risk to coastal seagrasses at the scale of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region ({\~{}}26,000km2) of Queensland, Australia. The risk assessment outputs identified agricultural, urban and industrial runoff, and urban and port developments as the major anthropogenic activities threatening coastal seagrasses. 'Hot spots' with multiple threat exposure were all in industrial port locations and the southern two-thirds of the GBR. There is a distinct discontinuity in threat exposure along the GBR coast with 98{\%} of seagrass meadows in the northern third exposed to only low levels of anthropogenic risk. The clustering of threat exposure is discussed in terms of coastal management policy. The approach outlined in this study provides management agencies a method of achieving maximum return for minimal investment in data collection at broad spatial scales by identifying sites where management intervention would be best targeted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, recent progress towards a theoretical synthesis now provides a guiding framework for organizing and integrating all primary data and methods for spatiotemporal assemblage-level inference in ecology. In this paper, we describe how recent theoretical developments can provide an organizing paradigm for linking advances in data collection and methodological frameworks across disparate ecological sub-disciplines and across large spatial and temporal scales. First, we summarize the set of fundamental processes that determine change in mul-tispecies assemblages across spatial and temporal scales by reviewing recent theoretical syntheses of community ecology. Second, we review recent advances in data and methods across the main sub-disciplines concerned with ecological inference across large spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, and organize them based on the primary fundamental processes they include, rather than the spatiotemporal scale of their inferences. Finally, we highlight how iteratively focusing on only one fundamental process at a time, but combining all relevant spatiotemporal data and methods, may reduce the conceptual challenges to integration among ecological sub-disciplines. Moreover, we discuss a number of avenues for decreasing the practical barriers to integration among data and methods. We aim to reconcile the recent convergence of decades of thinking in community ecology and macroecology theory with the rapid progress in spatiotemporal approaches for assemblage-level inference, at a time where a robust understanding of spatiotemporal change in ecological assemblages is more crucial than ever to conserve biodiversity.},

abstract = {Variability in the environment defines the structure and dynamics of all living systems, from organisms to ecosystems. Species have evolved traits and strategies that allow them to detect, exploit and predict the changing environment. These traits allow organisms to maintain steady internal conditions required for physiological functioning through feedback mechanisms that allow internal conditions to remain at or near a set-point despite a fluctuating environment. In addition to feedback, many organisms have evolved feedforward processes, which allow them to adjust in anticipation of an expected future state of the environment. Here we provide a framework describing how feedback and feedforward mechanisms operating within organisms can generate effects across scales of organization, and how they allow living systems to persist in fluctuating environments. Daily, seasonal and multi-year cycles provide cues that organisms use to anticipate changes in physiologically relevant environmental conditions. Using feedforward mechanisms, organisms can exploit correlations in environmental variables to prepare for anticipated future changes. Strategies to obtain, store and act on information about the conditional nature of future events are advantageous and are evidenced in widespread phenotypes such as circadian clocks, social behaviour, diapause and migrations. Humans are altering the ways in which the environment fluctuates, causing correlations between environmental variables to become decoupled, decreasing the reliability of cues. Human-induced environmental change is also altering sensory environments and the ability of organisms to detect cues. Recognizing that living systems combine feedback and feedforward processes is essential to understanding their responses to current and future regimes of environmental fluctuations.},

In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries.

abstract = {Environment-driven variation in the supply of individuals to local assemblages can determine patterns of community structure. Alternatively, local environmental conditions can determine the type of species that can be successfully established in a given community. Most communities are probably found somewhere between these 2 extremes, but few studies have attempted to disentangle their effects in a community-wide context. Using multivariate approaches in rocky shore communities, we showed that environmental variables (i.e. sea surface temperature and wind stress), the benthic abundance of 108 species of invertebrates and macroalgae, and recruitment rates of invertebrates all shared significant spatial and temporal patterns of variability across a 400 km shoreline marked by the presence of a prominent upwelling centre. Variance-partition analyses for the invertebrates with pelagic development showed that spatially structured environmental filtering alone explained only 7{\%} of the variation in community structure. In contrast, the combination of environmental conditions and recruitment variation explained 45{\%} of the variability in community structure and an additional 18{\%} was jointly explained by recruitment and spatial relationships among sampling sites. Unexplained variation (41{\%}) can be attributed to factors like local species interactions that are robust to environmental variability. Therefore, environment-driven variation in recruitment rates can have, in comparison to pure environmental filtering, stronger effects on the structure of this metacommunity. Our results can serve as a foundation for predictive models of the response of biodiversity to climate change and other human-induced disturbances, which are predicted to alter local environmental conditions and dispersal pathways.},

abstract = {Global species extinction rates are orders of magnitude above the background rate documented in the fossil record. However, recent data syntheses have found mixed evidence for patterns of net species loss at local spatial scales. For example, two recent data meta-analyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally representative of biodiversity change at local scales. Here we reanalyze results of these data syntheses and outline why this conclusion is unfounded. First, we show the datasets collated for these syntheses are spatially biased and not representative of the spatial distribution of species richness or the distribution of many primary drivers of biodiversity change. This casts doubt that their results are representative of global patterns. Second, we argue that detecting the trend in local species richness is very difficult with short time series and can lead to biased estimates of change. Reanalyses of the data detected a signal of study duration on biodiversity change, indicating net biodiversity loss is most apparent in studies of longer duration. Third, estimates of species richness change can be biased if species gains during post-disturbance recovery are included without also including species losses that occurred during the disturbance. Net species gains or losses should be assessed with respect to common baselines or reference communities. Ultimately, we need a globally coordinated effort to monitor biodiversity so that we can estimate and attribute human impacts as causes of biodiversity change. A combination of technologies will be needed to produce regularly updated global datasets of local biodiversity change to guide future policy. At this time the conclusion that there is no net change in local species richness is not the consensus state of knowledge.},

We carried out a meta-analysis of ecological effectiveness of IUCN Categories I-II (no-take), IV and VI (MPAs) compared to unprotected areas. We then applied our ecological effectiveness estimates - the added benefit of marine protection over and above conventional fisheries management - to a gap analysis of existing MPAs, and MPAs proposed by four indigenous groups on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Additionally, we assessed representation, size, spacing, and governance considerations against MPA design criteria outlined in the literature. We found significant differences in response ratios for IUCN Categories IV and VI MPAs compared to no-take reserves and areas open to fishing, although variability in responses was high. By rescaling the predicted ecological effectiveness ratios (including confidence estimates), we found that, compared to no-take reserves (biodiversity conservation effectiveness 100{\%}) and open fishing areas (0{\%} additional biodiversity contribution over and above conventional fisheries management), IUCN Category IV had a predicted effectiveness score of 60{\%}, ranging between 34{\%} and 89{\%} (95{\%} lower and upper confidence intervals, respectively), and IUCN Category VI had a predicted effectiveness score of 24{\%} (ranging between -12{\%} and 72{\%} for the 95{\%} lower and upper confidence intervals, respectively). We found that the existing MPAs did poorly when compared against most MPA design criteria, whereas the proposed MPA network achieved many of the best practices identified in the literature, and could achieve all if some additional sites were added. By using the Central Coast of British Columbia as a case study, we demonstrated a method for applying empirically-based ecological effectiveness estimates to an assessment of MPA design principles for an existing and proposed network of MPAs.},

This analysis indicates where protection and threat mitigation are most needed in the California Current and reveals that coastal ecosystems near high human population density and the continental shelves off Oregon and Washington are the most heavily impacted, climate change is the top threat, and impacts from multiple threats are ubiquitous. Remarkably, these results were highly spatially correlated with the global results for this region (R(2) = 0.92), suggesting that the global model provides guidance to areas without local data or resources to conduct similar regional-scale analyses.},

Nevertheless, sets of small patches usually harbor more species than one or a few larger patches of equal total area. Resolving this inconsistency is key to policy and practice in biodiversity conservation. Our analysis of 32 datasets (603 patches and 2290 taxa) provides two novel lines of evidence confirming that small patches have disproportionately high value for biodiversity. First, sets of small patches harbor more species than large patches even when considering only species of conservation concern. Second, sets of small patches harbor more species than large patches even when the small patches are very small compared to the large patches. Therefore, higher extinction risk in small than large patches does not decrease the cumulative value of small patches for biodiversity. We contend that acknowledging the conservation value of small patches, even very small patches, will be a necessary step for stemming biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene.},

Understanding the patterns of habitat connectivity that arise from the movement of multiple species can highlight the role of regional processes in maintaining local community structure. However, quantifying the probability and scale of dispersal for marine organisms remains a challenge. Here, we use a biophysical model to simulate dispersal, and we conduct a network analysis to predict connectivity patterns across scales for the community of invertebrates associated with seagrass habitat in British Columbia, Canada. We found many possible connections and few isolated habitat meadows, but the probability of most connections was low. Most habitat connections occurred within 3 days of dispersal time over short distances, indicating potential limits to long distance dispersal and little effect of species-specific dispersal abilities on the potential spatial extent of habitat connectivity. We then highlight the different roles that individual seagrass meadows can play in maintaining network connectivity. We also identify clusters of connected meadows and use these clusters to estimate the spatial scale of community dynamics. The connectivity patterns generated by our dispersal simulations highlight the importance of considering marine communities in their broad seascape context, with applications for the prioritization and conservation of habitat that maintains connectivity.},

abstract = {Dispersal of benthic species in the sea is mediated primarily through small, vulnerable larvae that must survive minutes to months as members of the plankton community while being transported by strong, dynamic currents. As climate change alters ocean conditions, the dispersal of these larvae will be affected, with pervasive ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review the impacts of oceanic changes on larval transport, physiology, and behavior. We then discuss the implications for population connectivity and recruitment and evaluate life history strategies that will affect susceptibility to the effects of climate change on their dispersal patterns, with implications for understanding selective regimes in a future ocean. We find that physical oceanographic changes will impact dispersal by transporting larvae in different directions or inhibiting their movements while changing environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, and turbidity, will affect the survival of larvae and alter their behavior. Reduced dispersal distance may make local adaptation more likely in well-connected populations with high genetic variation while reduced dispersal success will lower recruitment with implications for fishery stocks. Increased dispersal may spur adaptation by increasing genetic diversity among previously disconnected populations as well as increasing the likelihood of range expansions. We hypothesize that species with planktotrophic (feeding), calcifying, or weakly swimming larvae with specialized adult habitats will be most affected by climate change. We also propose that the adaptive value of retentive larval behaviors may decrease where transport trajectories follow changing climate envelopes and increase where transport trajectories drive larvae toward increasingly unsuitable conditions. Our holistic framework, combined with knowledge of regional ocean conditions and larval traits, can be used to produce powerful predictions of expected impacts on larval dispersal as well as the consequences for connectivity, range expansion, or recruitment. Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies take a holistic view of dispersal incorporating biological and oceanographic impacts of climate change rather than solely focusing on oceanography or physiology. Genetic and paleontological techniques can be used to examine evolutionary impacts of altered dispersal in a future ocean, while museum collections and expedition records can inform modern-day range shifts.},

abstract = {Habitat loss is one of the key drivers of the ongoing decline of biodiversity. However, ecologists still argue about how fragmentation of habitat (independent of habitat loss) affects species richness. The recently proposed habitat amount hypothesis posits that species richness only depends on the total amount of habitat in a local landscape. In contrast, empirical studies report contrasting patterns: some find positive and others negative effects of fragmentation per se on species richness. To explain this apparent disparity, we devise a stochastic, spatially explicit model of competitive species communities in heterogeneous habitats. The model shows that habitat loss and fragmentation have complex effects on species diversity in competitive communities. When the total amount of habitat is large, fragmentation per se tends to increase species diversity, but if the total amount of habitat is small, the situation is reversed: fragmentation per se decreases species diversity.},

However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of 'translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.},

We compiled geolocations and movement patterns for oil platforms, derelict/obsolete vessels, barges, dry docks, floating lodges, homes and docks, aquaculture gear and buoys for the NE Pacific coast. We related these data to NIS richness within the region and to global examples of SMS movement. Our review and synthesis of SMS, paired with biofouling surveys before and after dock towing events, reveal the growing NIS vector opportunities resulting from sprawling coastal infrastructure. As coastal development continues apace in the Anthropocene, this emerging management challenge will require strong frameworks and workable solutions for a global issue that currently lacks incentives to prevent species transfers and invasions.},

abstract = {The coral reefs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) are some of the most geographically isolated of the world. A key to understanding their long-term persistence and population recovery via dispersal (i.e. population connectivity), is knowing when the corals spawn in the region. To this end, we reviewed and synthesized the literature on the reproductive phenology of corals (month of spawning) and their dispersal-related characteristics to infer the potential impact on the region's functional connectivity. We classified the region into four thermal regimes based on long-term mean sea surface temperature (SST) data: Tropical Upwelling, Thermally Stable, Equatorial Upwelling, and Seasonal. Each regime's unique spawning seasonality was then explored by quantifying the linear dependence between the number of observed spawning events and SST. Finally, the potential impact of this unique regional mismatch in spawning was illustrated using a biophysical larval dispersal model. We found spawning occurs throughout the year in the Upwelling and Thermally Stable regimes (showing low or no linear dependence with SST); whereas spawning had a strong seasonal signal in the Equatorial Upwelling and Seasonal regimes, occurring primarily in the warm months. Considering the region's mismatch in spawning phenologies, and unique dispersal traits, the simulations of coral larval dispersal across the ETP result in infrequently realized connectivity between ecoregions, low local retention and high self-recruitment, that combined with low recruitment densities in the field indicates more vulnerable populations to disturbance than previously appreciated. The strong relationship between spawning phenology and SST in some regimes suggests a greater susceptibility of these coral assemblages to extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events and future ocean warming.},

abstract = {Aim: The great variation in range sizes among species has fascinated ecologists for decades. In reef-associated fish species, which live in fragmented habitats and adopt a wide range of dispersal strategies, we may expect species with greater dispersal ability to spread over larger ranges. However, empirical evidence for such a positive relationship between dispersal and range size in reef fishes remains scarce. Here, we unveil the more nuanced role of dispersal on the range size distribution of reef associated fishes using empirical data and a novel spatially explicit model. Location: Tropical Eastern Pacific Major taxa studied: Reef-associated fishes Methods: We estimated range size distributions for six different guilds of all reef-associated fishes with different dispersal abilities. We used a one-dimensional spatially explicit neutral model, which simulates the distribution of species along a linear coastline to explored the effect of dispersal, speciation and sampling on the distribution of range sizes. Our model adopts a more realistic gradual speciation process (protracted speciation) and incorporates important long distance dispersal events with a fat-tail dispersal kernel. We simulated our model using a highly efficient coalescence approach, which guarantees the metacommunity, is sampled at dynamic equilibrium. We fitted the model to the empirical data using an approximate Bayesian computation approach, with a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. Results: Stochastic birth, death, speciation and dispersal events alone can accurately explain empirical range size distributions for six different guilds of tropical, reef-associated fishes. Variation in range size distributions among guilds are explained purely by differences in dispersal ability with the best dispersers covering larger ranges. Main conclusions: A simple combination of neutral processes with guild-specific dispersal ability provides a general explanation for both within- and across-guild range size variation. Our results support the theoretically expected, but empirically much debated, hypothesis that dispersal promotes range size.},

abstract = {Predators can influence the structure and function of ecosystems by altering the composition or behavior of herbivore communities. Overexploitation of predators, therefore, may lead to habitat loss by altering important top-down interactions that facilitate habitat-forming species. In seagrass beds, top-down control of algal growth by mesograzers appears to facilitate seagrass production. The indirect consequences of higher-order trophic interactions, however, remain unclear. Although predators may limit the beneficial effects of algal mesograzers, it is also possible that they limit the abundance of invertebrates that consume and foul seagrasses. We used experimental enclosure and exclosure cages to explore the direct and indirect effects of microcarnivorous fishes on epifaunal invertebrates, epiphytic loads, and seagrass growth in a natural eelgrass (Zostera marina) bed in San Diego Bay, California, USA. Contrary to expectations, when fishes were excluded, invertebrate abundance increased by 300-1000{\%}, fouling on eelgrass leaves increased by 600{\%}, and eelgrass production declined by 50{\%}. Despite high densities of predators in enclosures, subsequent effects did not differ from ambient conditions. When predators were excluded, however, abundances of epifauna (including tube-building crustaceans and an eelgrass-grazing limpet) increased dramatically, resulting in reduced seagrass production. Our results are supported by several studies of eelgrass communities in the northeastern Pacific, characterized by coastal upwelling, inverse estuaries, and a voracious seagrass-consuming limpet. These strong, positive, indirect effects of microcarnivores on seagrass production contrast with the beneficial mesograzer paradigm, highlighting the need for hypotheses to be tested across a variety of ecosystems with varying biophysical characteristics.},

abstract = {With increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, the extent of effects on the ocean and marine resources is an increasing concern. One aspect of this issue is the ongoing process (known as ocean acidification) whereby seawater becomes less alkaline as more CO2 dissolves in it, causing hydrogen ion concentration in seawater to increase. Scientists are concerned that increasing hydrogen ion concentration could reduce growth or even cause death of shell-forming animals (e.g., corals, mollusks, and certain planktonic organisms) as well as disrupt marine food webs and the reproductive physiology of certain species. While not yet fully understood, the ecological and economic consequences of ocean acidification could be substantial. Scientists are concerned that increasing hydrogen ion concentration in seawater could alter biogeochemical cycles, disrupt physiological processes of marine organisms, and damage marine ecosystems. This report does not discuss the effects of increasing thermal stress to marine organisms and ecosystems (e.g., coral bleaching) related to climate change. However, marine ecosystems are likely to be affected by the synergistic effects of factors involved in both thermal and chemical processes. Congress is beginning to focus attention on better understanding ocean acidification and determining how this concern might be addressed. In the 111th Congress, the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act of 2009 (Title XII, Subtitle D, of P.L. 111-11) directed the Secretary of Commerce to establish an ocean acidification program within NOAA, established an interagency committee to develop an ocean acidification research and monitoring plan, and authorized appropriations through FY2012 for NOAA and the National Science Foundation.

abstract = {Marine biophysical models can be used to explore the displacement of individuals in and between submarine canyons. Mostly, the studies focus on the shallow hydrodynamics in or around a single canyon. In the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, knowledge of the deep-sea circulation and its spatial variability in three contiguous submarine canyons is limited. We used a Lagrangian framework with three-dimensional velocity fields from two versions of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to study the deep-bottom connectivity between submarine canyons and to compare their influence on the particle transport. From a biological point of view, the particles represented eggs and larvae spawned by the deep-sea commercial shrimp Aristeus antennatus along the continental slope in summer. The passive particles mainly followed a southwest drift along the continental slope and drifted less than 200 km considering a pelagic larval duration (PLD) of 31 d. Two of the submarine canyons were connected by more than 27{\%} of particles if they were released at sea bottom depths above 600 m. The vertical advection of particles depended on the depth where particles were released and the circulation influenced by the morphology of each submarine canyon. Therefore, the impact of contiguous submarine canyons on particle transport should be studied on a case-by-case basis and not be generalized. Because the flows were strongly influenced by the bottom topography, the hydrodynamic model with finer bathymetric resolution data, a less smoothed bottom topography, and finer sigma-layer resolution near the bottom should give more accurate simulations of near-bottom passive drift. Those results propose that the physical model parameterization and discretization have to be considered for improving connectivity studies of deep-sea species.},

abstract = {Classical demographic methods applied to life history data on the northern spotted owl yield an estimate of the annual geometric rate of increase for the population of A=0.96+0.03, which is not significantly different from that for a stable population (i= 1.00). Sensitivity analysis indicates that adult annual survivorship has by far the larg- est influence on A, followed by the probability that juveniles survive dispersal, and the adult annual fecundity. Substan- tial temporal fluctuations in demographic parameters have little effect on the long-run growth rate of the population because of the long adult life expectancy. A model of dis- persal and territory occupancy that assumes demographic equilibrium is evaluated using data on the amount of old forest habitat remaining in the Pacific Northwest and the current occupancy of this habitat by northern spotted owls. This model is employed to predict the effect of future habitat loss and fragmentation on the population, implying that extinction will result if the old forest is reduced to less than a proportion 0.21 + 0.02 of the total area in a large region. The estimated minimum habitat requirement for the popu- lation is greater than that allowed in management plans by the USDA Forest Service. Key},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that influence the successful recruitment of marine species is one of the great challenges in marine science, particularly for species that undergo a protracted larval phase. Here we apply a bio-physical individual-based model (IBM) which couples data from a high-resolution oceano- graphic model with temperature-related survival characteristics for the early life stage of a temperate marine fish. The IBM was run retrospectively for the years 1993–2007 with spawning locations occurring around Tasmania, Australia. Meso-scale oceano- graphic features led to individuals spawned on the west coast, and to a lesser extent the south coast, being washed ashore prior to achieving a competent size to actively influence their migratory paths. Individuals spawned on the east coast had significantly higher survival rates. Temperature-induced mortality was relatively consistent across years. This indicates that the dispersal envelopes, of pre-flexion larvae, across all years are predominately within the thermal niche of this species. To further understand the effect of tem- perature on survival we integrated global climate model warming scenarios into the model. The results indicated that around the year 2050 the predicted warming would have a minor positive effect on the survival of individuals but by 2100 the pejus temperature will frequently be exceeded leading to a signifi- cant decline in survival, particularly towards the northern end of the dispersal range.},

abstract = {A toxicant-dosed metapopulation model was used to explore the range of possible dynamics of populations in contaminated field sites. A single species metapopulation model was developed that is discrete, deterministic, and incorporates dose-response curves and biotic growth rates to describe the effects of contamination on a metapopulation. The distribution of the chemical contamination is assumed limited to one patch and contagious within that patch. Both persistent and degradable toxicants were modeled. Five principal conclusions resulted from our simulation studies. (1) Mortality in one subpopulation has ecologically significant effects on nondosed subpopulations. This hypothesis we term 'action at a distance' because no direct contact with a toxicant has occurred except in the dosed patch. (2) Because uncontaminated sites connected to the contaminated site by migration of the biota are affected, these uncontaminated sites cannot be reference sites. (3) The arrangement of the patches is critical to the dynamics of the system and the overall impact of a toxicant. (4) Due to the contagious distribution of the toxicant and the stochastic function describing exposure effect, multiple discrete outcomes often are possible from the same initial conditions. These outcomes can range from extinction to the reaching of the carrying capacity for a patch. (5) If sufficient cleanup is not possible, it may be necessary to isolate the contaminated patch, allowing the formerly connected patches to regain more typical population dynamics.},

abstract = {In coastal marine food webs, small invertebrate herbivores (mesograzers) have long been hypothesized to occupy an important position facilitating dominance of habitatforming macrophytes by grazing competitively superior epiphytic algae. Because of the difficulty of manipulating mesograzers in the field, however, their impacts on community organization have rarely been rigorously documented. Understanding mesograzer impacts has taken on increased urgency in seagrass systems due to declines in seagrasses globally, caused in part by widespread eutrophication favoring seagrass overgrowth by faster-growing algae. Using cage-free field experiments in two seasons (fall and summer), we present experimental confirmation that mesograzer reduction and nutrients can promote blooms of epiphytic algae growing on eelgrass (Zostera marina). In this study, nutrient additions increased epiphytes only in the fall following natural decline of mesograzers. In the summer, experimental mesograzer reduction stimulated a 447{\%} increase in epiphytes, appearing to exacerbate seasonal dieback of eelgrass. Using structural equation modeling, we illuminate the temporal dynamics of complex interactions between macrophytes, mesograzers, and epiphytes in the summer experiment. An unexpected result emerged from investigating the interaction network: drift macroalgae indirectly reduced epiphytes by providing structure for mesograzers, suggesting that the net effect of macroalgae on seagrass depends on macroalgal density. Our results show that mesograzers can control proliferation of epiphytic algae, that top-down and bottom-up forcing are temporally variable, and that the presence of macroalgae can strengthen top-down control of epiphytic algae, potentially contributing to eelgrass persistence. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Metacommunity ecology addresses the situation where sets of local communities are connected by the dispersal of a number of potentially interacting species. Aquatic systems (e.g. lentic versus lotic versus marine) differ from each other in connectivity and environmental heterogeneity, suggesting that metacommunity organisation also differs between major aquatic systems. Here, we review findings from observational field studies on metacommunity organisation in aquatic systems. 2. Species sorting (i.e. species are ‘filtered' by environmental factors and occur only at environmen- tally suitable sites) prevails in aquatic systems, particularly in streams and lakes, but the degree to which dispersal limitation interacts with such environmental control varies among different systems and spatial scales. For example, mainstem rivers and marine coastal systems may be strongly affected by ‘mass effects' (i.e. where high dispersal rates homogenise communities to some degree at neighbouring localities, irrespective of their abiotic and biotic environmental conditions), whereas isolated lakes and ponds may be structured by dispersal limitation (i.e. some species do not occur at otherwise-suitable localities simply because sites with potential colonists are too far away). Flow directionality in running waters also differs from water movements in other systems, and this differ- ence may also have effects on the role of dispersal in different aquatic systems. 3. Dispersal limitation typically increases with increasing spatial distance between sites, mass effects potentially increase in importance with decreasing distance between sites, and the dispersal ability of organisms may determine the spatial extents at which species sorting and dispersal processes are most important. 4. A better understanding of the relative roles of species sorting, mass effects and dispersal limitation in affecting aquatic metacommunities requires the following: (i) characterising dispersal rates more directly or adopting better proxies than have been used previously; (ii) considering the nature of aquatic networks; (iii) combining correlative and experimental approaches; (iv) exploring temporal aspects of metacommunity organisation and (v) applying past approaches and statistical methods innovatively for increasing our understanding of metacommunity organisation.},

abstract = {Resilience is usually defined as the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb distur- bance without shifting to an alternative state and losing function and services [1–3]. The concept therefore encompasses two separate processes: resistance—the magnitude of disturbance that causes a change in structure—and recovery—the speed of return to the original structure [4,5]—which are fundamentally different but rarely distinguished. Yet, resilience has become a central concept in the manage- ment of natural ecosystems [6,7]. Many current management actions aim to alle- viate local stressors in an effort to increase ecosystem resilience to global climate change [8,9]. Such a management philos- ophy is premised on the belief that eliminating local drivers of ecological change will increase the ability of an ecosystem to resist future climate distur- bances, its ability to recover from such disturbances, or both [2,6]. Measuring resilience is fraught with difficulties [1,3]. Nevertheless, assessing changes in resil- ience as a result of management action is critical because there is general agreement for the existence of a strong link between resilience and sustainability [10]. Success- fully increasing the resilience of natural systems may therefore have important implications for human welfare in the face of global climate change.},

We summarize the types of MPA networks based on their intended management outcomes and illustrate a framework for evaluating whether a connectivity network is providing an outcome greater than the sum of individual MPA effects. We use an analysis of an MPA network in Hawai'i to compare networked MPAs to non-networked MPAs to demonstrate results consistent with a network effect. We assert that planning processes for MPA networks should identify their intended outcomes while also employing coupled field monitoring-simulation modeling approaches, a powerful way to prioritize the most relevant monitoring data for empirically assessing MPA network performance.},

abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is an interconnected system of thousands of coral reefs and shoals spanning more than 2,000 km of the eastern Australian coastline. Anthropogenic pressures—principally climate change—pose an existential threat to this iconic marine ecosystem [1]. Management actions are urgently required to halt and reverse the degradation, but the GBR's enormous size creates logistical and budgetary challenges. In a recent research article, Hock and colleagues [2] offer a solution to this predicament: They argue that a tiny fraction of the GBR's reefs—fewer than 1{\%}—act as its ‘life-support system' [3]. The reefs are primarily identified by their larval connectivity, the movement of juvenile individuals between reefs on ocean currents. A dispersive larval stage is common to many species on coral reefs—notably fishes and reef-building corals—and is an essential source of new recruits following mortality and disturbance. Unfortunately, because larvae are difficult and expensive to follow during their pelagic dispersal phase, empirical data are not available at management-relevant scales [4]. Instead, Hock and colleagues base their decisions on ‘biophysical models'—computer simulations that integrate individual-based models of larval behaviour with hydrodynamic ocean current models. In recent years, biophysical models have become a standard tool for investigating the effects of larval connectivity on marine ecology, evolution, and conservation [4–6]. Because their biophysical model predicts that a small number of reefs contribute disproportionately to the GBR's persistence and resilience, Hock and colleagues claim that these reefs should be a primary focus of management resources. In this comment, we show that the identity of these reefs should be treated with caution, since different numerical models of larval connectivity select different reefs as priorities. More generally, we argue that the current generation of biophysical models should not be used to guide management actions at the scale of individual reefs. The last decade has seen rapid advances in the sophistication of biophysical models. High-performance computing allows these models to simulate billions of larval releases across thousands of kilometres, while their biological components now incorporate experimentally measured sensory and swimming capabilities. However, despite these strengths, accurate numerical modelling of shallow coastal flow fields with highly variable bathymetry—conditions typical of coral reefs—remains an immense challenge. Critical near-reef hydrodynamics often vary at substantially smaller scales (1 m–1,000 m) than the resolution of biophysical models (100 m–10,000 m; [7]). Such difficulties are exacerbated by uncertainty about the parameters that describe larval development, behaviour, and mortality, as well as adult spawning behaviour [6]. These limitations have been debated extensively [8]; given this level of uncertainty, we have strong reservations about whether existing biophysical models are accurate enough to identify reefs that have particular larval connectivity characteristics or to identify the type of life-support system highlighted in [2]. To test this question, we repeated Hock and colleagues' analyses using a different model of larval dispersal on the GBR. While not identical, the two models are functionally equivalent: comparable in complexity, resolution, and scale. They are both based on hydrodynamic models of the entire GBR and predict the dispersal of numerous species from multiple larval spawning events across many years (see S1 Text). We used the predictions of this alternative model to reclassify ‘key source reefs', a critical step in Hock and colleagues' methodology. They identified 545 key sources, which they define as reefs that exhibit (i) high out degree, (ii) high node strength, (iii) a large number of strong connections, (iv) strong connections to other key sources, and (v) high connectedness. Precise mathematical definitions are detailed in [2]. Despite the similarities between the two biophysical models, they identify very different key source reefs (Fig 1). Both models prioritise reefs in the mid and outer shelf, but the alternative model chooses reefs throughout the central GBR and in the inner-shelf Whitsunday region, where Hock and colleagues found no key sources. Overall, only 32{\%} of the key sources prioritised by our alternative model were also highlighted by Hock and colleagues. Moreover, a substantial proportion (19{\%}) of the key sources identified in [2] are among the worst reefs according to the alternative model, consistently delivering the lowest performance according to all five criteria.},

Successful application of MPAs will be predicated on the ability to monitor biodiversity in a synoptic and noninvasive manner. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods have important advantages over traditional biodiversity survey methods for monitoring conservation areas. To evaluate the efficacy of eDNA metabarcoding for fish biodiversity monitoring, we sampled 19 coastal eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in Canada, as eelgrass beds are known for high biodiversity and significant conservation value. At each site, beach seines were used to survey fish and water samples were collected contemporaneously for eDNA metabarcoding. In total, beach seining caught 32 672 individuals across 59 fish taxa, and eDNA detected 129 fish taxa. eDNA captured site-level variation and detected higher species richness at both site and regional levels compared to seining. eDNA abundance had a positive association with capture abundance. Collectively these results highlight how eDNA metabarcoding offers an efficient approach for monitoring fish biodiversity in coastal eelgrass beds, thus providing a valuable and noninvasive tool for MPA planning and coastal monitoring.},

abstract = {Motivated by the need to solve ecological problems (climate change, habitat fragmentation and biological invasions), there has been increasing interest in species distribution models (SDMs). Predictions from these models inform conservation policy, invasive species management and disease-control measures. However, predictions are subject to uncertainty, the degree and source of which is often unrecognized. Here, we review the SDM literature in the context of uncertainty, focusing on three main classes of SDM: niche-based models, demographic models and process-based models. We identify sources of uncertainty for each class and discuss how uncertainty can be minimized or included in the modelling process to give realistic measures of confidence around predictions. Because this has typically not been performed, we conclude that uncertainty in SDMs has often been underestimated and a false precision assigned to predictions of geographical distribution. We identify areas where development of new statistical tools will improve predictions from distribution models, notably the development of hierarchical models that link different types of distribution model and their attendant uncertainties across spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the need to develop more defensible methods for assessing predictive performance, quantifying model goodness-of-fit and for assessing the significance of model covariates.},

abstract = {Coastal, benthic invertebrates with complex life history strategies are exposed to stage- and habitat-specific selective forces. In the coastal environment, benthic adults are exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollutants (PAHs) due to their proximity to human activities (shipping, urbanization, and industrialization). Benthic invertebrates produce lipid-rich eggs or larvae that absorb PAHs from polluted estuaries and coastal waters. The larvae of many coastal invertebrates move offshore following release from benthic adults. During development in offshore waters, larvae of some species are exposed to relatively high levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Marine organisms vary in their tolerance to PAHs and UV radiation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the sequential exposure of the larvae of marine crabs to PAHs and UV radiation. Using laboratory experiments, the larvae of four crab species were exposed to PAHs and UV radiation. There was a significant synergistic effect of exposure to PAH (fluoranthene or pyrene) and UV radiation on larvae of the spider crab (Libinia dubia), the stone crab (Menippe adina) and the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii). Larvae of blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) were exposed to PAHs and UV radiation in both laboratory and solar UV experiments. Significantly higher mortality occurred for C. sapidus larvae using either type of UV-artificial or solar. Larvae of coastal invertebrates with complex life history strategies are susceptible to the combined effects of PAHs and UV radiation. In this study, the exposure of crab larvae to PAHs and UV radiation resulted in mortality to crab larvae using laboratory and solar UV experiments. There were no effects on larval crab mortality due to PAH or UV radiation independently but mortality was as high as 100{\%} when both factors were present. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Marine populations are typically characterized by weak genetic differentiation due to the potential for long-distance dispersal favouring high levels of gene flow. However, strong directional advection of water masses or retentive hydrodynamic forces can influence the degree of genetic exchange among marine populations. To determine the oceanographic drivers of genetic structure in a highly dispersive marine invertebrate, the giant California sea cucumber (Parastichopus californicus), we first tested for the presence of genetic discontinuities along the coast of North America in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Then, we tested two hypotheses regarding spatial processes influencing population structure: (i) isolation by distance (IBD: genetic structure is explained by geographic distance) and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR: genetic structure is driven by ocean circulation). Using RADseq, we genotyped 717 individuals from 24 sampling locations across 2,719 neutral SNPs to assess the degree of population differentiation and integrated estimates of genetic variation with inferred connectivity probabilities from a biophysical model of larval dispersal mediated by ocean currents. We identified two clusters separating north and south regions, as well as significant, albeit weak, substructure within regions (FST = 0.002, p =.001). After modelling the asymmetric nature of ocean currents, we demonstrated that local oceanography (IBR) was a better predictor of genetic variation (R2 =.49) than geographic distance (IBD) (R2 =.18), and directional processes played an important role in shaping fine-scale structure. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature identifying significant population structure in marine systems and has important implications for the spatial management of P. californicus and other exploited marine species.},

abstract = {Increasing dispersal duration should result in increasing dispersal distance, facilitating higher gene flow among populations. As such, it has long been predicted that genetic structure (e.g. F ST) among populations of marine species should be strongly correlated with pelagic larval duration (PLD). However, previous studies have repeatedly shown a surprisingly poor correspondence. This result has been frequently interpreted as evidence for larval behaviours or physical oceanographic processes that result in larvae failing to reach their dispersal potential, or error inherent in estimating PLD and F ST. This study employed a computer modelling approach to explore the impacts of various uncertainties on the correlation between measures of genetic differentiation such as F ST and PLD. Results indicate that variation resulting from PLD estimation error had minor impacts on the correlation between genetic structure and PLD. However, variation in effective population size between species, errors in F ST estimation and non-equilibrium F ST values all had major impacts, resulting in dramatically weaker correlations between PLD and F ST. These results suggest that poor correlations between PLD and F ST may result from variation and uncertainty in the terms associated with the calculation of F ST values. As such, PLD may be a much stronger determinant of realized larval dispersal than suggested by the weak-to-moderate correlations between PLD and F ST reported in empirical studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Delmas2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge Philosophical Society Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

Simulated extinction scenarios forecast marked declines in functional richness if current trajectories are maintained during the next century (11{\%} globally; up to 24{\%} regionally), with more marked reductions (48{\%} globally; up to 70{\%} at the poles) beyond random expectations if all threatened species eventually go extinct. Among the megafaunal groups, sharks will incur a disproportionate loss of functional richness. We identify top FUSE species and suggest a renewed focus on these species to preserve the ecosystem functions provided by marine megafauna.},

abstract = {The dispersal of individuals among marine populations is of great importance to meta- population dynamics, population persistence, and species expansion. Understanding this connectivity between distant populations is key to their effective conservation and management. For many marine species, population connectivity is determined largely by ocean currents transporting larvae and juveniles between distant patches of suitable habitat. Recent work has focused on the biophysics of marine larval dispersal and its importance to population dynamics, although few studies have evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of this potential dispersal. Here, we show how an Eulerian advection–diffusion approach can be used to model the dispersal of coral larvae between reefs throughout the Tropical Pacific. We illustrate how this connectivity can be analyzed using graph theory—an effective approach for exploring patterns in spatial connections, as well as for determining the importance of each site and pathway to local and regional connectivity. Results indicate that the scale (average distance) of dispersal in the Pacific is on the order of 50–150 km, consistent with recent studies in the Caribbean (Cowen, et al. 2006). Patterns in the dispersal graphs highlight pathways for larval dispersal along major ocean currents and through island chains. A series of critical island ‘stepping stones' are discovered providing potential pathways across the equatorial currents and connect- ing distant island groups. Patterns in these dispersal graphs highlight possible pathways for species expansions, reveal connected upstream/downstream populations, and suggest areas that might be priori- tized for marine conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Design of protected areas has focused on setting targets for representation of biodiversity, but often these targets do not include prescriptions as to how large protected areas should be or where they should be located. Principles of island biogeography theory have been applied with some success, but they have limitations. The so-called SLOSS (single large or several small reserves) debate hinged on applications of island biogeography theory to protected areas but was resolved only to the point that parties agreed there might be different approaches in different situations. Although proponents on both sides of the SLOSS debate generally agree that replicating protected areas is desirable, it is difficult to determine how to replicate reserves in terms of number and spatial arrangement. More important, many targets for representation often do not address issues of species persistence. Here, we used a geographic information system in a study of disturbance- sensitive mammals of the Yukon Territory, Canada, to design a protected-areas network that maintains a historical assemblage of species goals for component ecoregions. We simultaneously determined patterns of diversity as Whittaker's beta and compositional turnover and examined how these two measures can give further insights into reserve location and spatial arrangement. Both regional heterogeneity and compositional turnover between nonadjacent sites were significant predictors of the number of protected areas necessary to represent mammals within each ecoregion. Thus, protected-area planners can use diversity measures to identify number and spacing of protected areas within ecologically bounded regions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Aim: Long-distance dispersal (LDD) events occur rarely but play a fundamental role in shaping species biogeography. Lying at the heart of island biogeography theory, LDD relies on unusual events to facilitate colonization of new habitats and range expansion. Despite the importance of LDD, it is inherently difficult to quantify due to the rarity of such events. We estimate the probability of LDD of the seagrass Heterozostera nigricaulis, a common Australian species, across the Pacific Ocean to colonize South America. Location: Coastal Chile, Australia and the Pacific Ocean. Methods: Genetic analyses of H. nigricaulis collected from Chile and Australia were used to assess the relationship between the populations and levels of clonality. Ocean surface current models were used to predict the probability of propagules dispersing from south-east Australia to central Chile and shipping data used to determine the likelihood of anthropogenic dispersal. Results: Our study infers that the seagrass H. nigricaulis dispersed from Australia across the entire width of the Pacific (c. 14,000 km) to colonize South America on two occasions. Genetic analyses reveal that these events led to two large isolated clones, one of which covers a combined area of 3.47 km 2 . Oceanographic models estimate the arrival probability of a dispersal propagule within 3 years to be at most 0.00264{\%}. Early shipping provides a potential alternative dispersal vector, yet few ships sailed from SE Australia to Chile prior to the first recording of H. nigricaulis and the lack of more recent and ongoing introductions demonstrate the rarity of such dispersal. Main conclusions: These findings demonstrate LDD does occur over extreme distances despite very low probabilities. The large number of propagules (100s of millions) produced over 100s of years suggests that the arrival of propagules in Chile was inevitable and confirms the importance of LDD for species distributions and community ecology.},

However, such problems are of paramount importance, e.g., dispersal of marine larval plankton is critical for the health of coral reefs, and aerial plankton (tiny arthropods) can be used as effective agricultural biocontrol agents. Here we introduce the open-source, agent-based modeling software Planktos targeted at 2D and 3D fluid environments in Python. Agents in this modeling framework are relatively tiny organisms in sufficiently low densities that their effect on the surrounding fluid motion can be considered negligible. This library can be used for scientific exploration and quantification of collective and emergent behavior, including interaction with immersed structures. In this paper, we detail the implementation and functionality of the library along with some illustrative examples. Functionality includes arbitrary agent behavior obeying either ordinary differential equations, stochastic differential equations, or coded movement algorithms, all under the influence of time-dependent fluid velocity fields generated by computational fluid dynamics, experiments, or analytical models in domains with static immersed mesh structures with sliding or sticky collisions. In addition, data visualization tools provide images or animations with kernel density estimation and velocity field analysis with respect to deterministic agent behavior via the finite-time Lyapunov exponent.},

This generates a gap between basic research and applicable solutions for conservation managers faced with multifaceted problems.

abstract = {Effective management of threatened and exploited species requires an understanding of both the genetic connectivity among populations and local adaptation. The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), patchily distributed from Baja California to the central coast of Canada, has a long history of population declines due to anthropogenic stressors. For such coastal marine species, population structure could follow a continuous isolation-by-distance model, contain regional blocks of genetic similarity separated by barriers to gene flow, or be consistent with a null model of no population structure. To distinguish between these hypotheses in O. lurida, 13,424 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to characterize rangewide population structure, genetic connectivity, and adaptive divergence. Samples were collected across the species range on the west coast of North America, from southern California to Vancouver Island. A conservative approach for detecting putative loci under selection identified 235 SNPs across 129 GBS loci, which were functionally annotated and analyzed separately from the remaining neutral loci. While strong population structure was observed on a regional scale in both neutral and outlier markers, neutral markers had greater power to detect fine-scale structure. Geographic regions of reduced gene flow aligned with known marine biogeographic barriers, such as Cape Mendocino, Monterey Bay, and the currents around Cape Flattery. The outlier loci identified as under putative selection included genes involved in developmental regulation, sensory information processing, energy metabolism, immune response, and muscle contraction. These loci are excellent candidates for future research and may provide targets for genetic monitoring programs. Beyond specific applications for restoration and management of the Olympia oyster, this study lends to the growing body of evidence for both population structure and adaptive differentiation across a range of marine species exhibiting the potential for panmixia. Computational notebooks are available to facilitate reproducibility and future open-sourced research on the population structure of O. lurida.},

abstract = {Aim: Connectivity assessments are crucial to large-scale conservation planning, in particular for establishing and monitoring connected networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). Using biophysical modelling and genetic analyses, we assessed potential and realized connectivity among MPA populations of a benthic foundation species, the Mediterranean endemic seagrass Posidonia oceanica. Location: Adriatic and Ionian seas (central Mediterranean). Methods: We assessed potential and realized connectivity among eight P. oceanica meadows, mostly located in MPAs. Potential connectivity was assessed over a time horizon of 10 years via an individual-based biophysical model whose physical component relies on fine-scale spatio-temporal ocean circulation fields. Genetic assessments of realized connectivity were carried out by means of a set of 14 neutral microsatellite loci, as well as a larger dataset of 19 loci including outlier loci that did not conform to expectations under neutrality. Results: Our findings point out a relatively high potential connectivity through long-range dispersal of floating fruits. Genetic connectivity analyses show a complex scenario with an apparent lower realized connectivity. The P. oceanica meadow within Torre Guaceto MPA (TOG), a well-enforced MPA within our study area, showed one of the highest levels of genotypic richness, indicative of high levels of sexual reproduction and/or recruitment of foreign genotypes. Both biophysical modelling and population genetics indicate that TOG is important to ensure the viability of the species at the local scale, and does likely play a key role as a source of propagules for the whole Adriatic area. Main conclusions: Our results show that realized dispersal does not necessarily match with the potential for dispersal. Still, both genetic and physical connectivity analyses show good agreement in identifying hotspots of connectivity. Such information can guide management of networks of MPAs and advance conservation of marine biodiversity.},

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25{\%} of the communities are badly connected and up to 16{\%} are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

abstract = {Natural history is the careful observation of nature, wherever nature is. Ultimately, it is what ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral science are supposed to explain. It is difficult to use natural history alone to test hypotheses in these fields because of the complex paths between process and pattern. Few patterns are predicted by one and only one hypothesis, so experiments are almost always necessary. However, the robustness of experimental results depends on how well experimental conditions reflect the integration of natural history. Natural history also plays a vital role in how well we can apply Krogh's principle to our work. Krogh's principle is that scientists begin with an important hypothesis and find a system (organism, habitat, species interaction) with which to test it. However, natural history is essential for knowing whether the question applies to the system or whether we are forcing the question on the system. There is value in beginning one's research not by identifying an interesting question and searching for the right system but by identifying an interesting system in which to ask the right question. This approach carries the danger of parochialism, which can be avoided only by having a command of theory as well as natural history. A command of both areas allows nature to tell us which question to ask instead of demanding that nature answer the question we find most interesting.},

Yet, many MPAs fail to achieve their management objectives because of shortfalls in understanding the level of legitimacy stakeholders afford to an MPA. Legitimacy refers to the ability of a political action, in this case an MPA, to be perceived as right and just by the various people who are involved, interested, and/or affected by it. Using responses from key stakeholders and managers at two coastal MPAs in Atlantic Canada, this study examined the importance of various factors shaping perceptions of MPA effectiveness and the role of legitimacy in influencing those perceptions. Results indicate that most indicators of legitimacy are important to stakeholders for MPA effectiveness. Specifically, there was consensus across case studies on the importance of community leadership and the establishment of trust in determining the level of legitimacy afforded to MPAs. However key differences in perceptions were evident from stakeholders both between and within groups, and between stakeholders and MPA managers. A novel legitimacy framework and a stakeholder-vetted suite of indicators for legitimacy are presented and recommended for use by MPA managers in assessing the legitimacy of coastal MPAs, before, during and after MPA designation. The results provide an increased understanding of stakeholders' perceptions of legitimacy, giving managers key additional information needed to establish effective MPAs in the future.},

The model developed here uses the historical relationship between precipitation and runoff and applies it to the ungauged areas to produce an estimate of ungauged flow. The combination of gauged and ungauged flow is then used to estimate the total freshwater discharge affecting the coastal waters of British Columbia. A distinction is made between pluvial and nival-glacial watersheds to accommodate their widely different precipitation regimes within the study area. Calendar Year and Water Year variants of the model are tested with the Water Year version proving to be superior for short time-span evaluations. Hindcasts are computed for the period 1970 to 2009, and the average annual runoff for the study area is found to be 998 km3. No statistically significant trend is found for the forty-year time series. Runoff estimates from a subset of the study area are shown to match an earlier study that used area scaling, rather than precipitation scaling. The freshwater flux estimated by this method is twice the flux predicted for this region by a global runoff model but that global model reported a suspected under-representation of precipitation.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long been interested in how communities change over time. Addressing questions about community dynamics requires ways of representing and comparing the variety of dynamics observed across space. Until now, most analytical frameworks have been based on the comparison of synchronous observations across sites and between repeated surveys. An alternative perspective considers community dynamics as trajectories in a chosen space of community resemblance and utilizes trajectories as objects to be analyzed and compared using their geometry. While methods that take this second perspective exist, for example to test for particular trajectory shapes, there is a need for formal analytical frameworks that fully develop the potential of this approach. By adapting concepts and procedures used for the analysis of spatial trajectories, we present a framework for describing and comparing community trajectories. A key element of our contribution is the means to assess the geometric resemblance between trajectories, which allows users to describe, quantify, and analyze variation in community dynamics. We illustrate the behavior of our framework using simulated data and two spatiotemporal community data sets differing in the community properties of interest (species composition vs. size distribution of individuals). We conclude by evaluating the advantages and limitations of our community trajectory analysis framework, highlighting its broad domain of application and anticipating potential extensions.},

abstract = {Abstract Establishment of protected areas to maintain biodiversity requires identification, prioritization, and management of stressors that may undermine conservation goals. Nonindigenous species and climate change are critical ecosystem stressors that need greater attention in the context of spatial planning and management of protected areas. Risk of invasion into protected areas needs to be quantified under current and projected climate conditions in conjunction with prioritization of key vectors and vulnerable areas to enable development of effective management strategies. We assessed the likelihood of invasion across networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) to determine how invaded MPAs may compromise MPA networks by sharing nonindigenous species. We evaluated invasion risk in 83 MPAs along Canada?s Pacific coast for eight nonindigenous species based on environmental suitability under current and future (average conditions from 2041-2070) climate conditions and association with shipping and boating pathways. We applied species distribution models and network analysis of vessel tracking data for 805 vessels in 2016 that connected MPAs. The probability of occurrence within MPAs and the proportion of MPA area that is suitable to the modelled species significantly increased under future climate conditions, with six species reaching over 90{\%} predicted occurrence across MPAs and over 70{\%} of suitable area within MPAs. Vessel traffic created four network clusters of 61 highly connected MPAs that spanned the coastline. Occupancy of over 90{\%} of the MPAs within the clusters was predicted for most species. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a high likelihood of marine protected area (MPA) network invasion based on current and future environmental conditions and vectors of spread, and the potential for extensive nonindigenous species distributions within MPAs. Our approach highlights how interacting stressors can exacerbate MPA susceptibility to nonindigenous species, adding further challenges for protected area management. Management planning that invests in understanding connectivity and vector processes (human behaviors) is more likely to derive effective policies to stem the flow of nonindigenous species under both current and future conditions. In particular, biosecurity measures including vessel biofouling regulations and MPA- and MPA network-specific plans for prevention, monitoring, and mitigation of nonindigenous species are needed.},

abstract = {Terrestrial plants seeds, spores and pollen are often dispersed by wind. Likewise, most eggs and larvae of marine organisms are dispersed by oceanic currents. It was historically believed that the spatial scale at which dispersal occurs was orders of magnitude smaller for plants than for fish. However, recent empirical estimates of seed and larval dispersal suggest that these dispersal scales are more alike than previously thought. The modeling approaches used to simulate aerial and aquatic dispersal are also converging. Similar biophysical models are developed, in which outputs of Eulerian models simulating the main physical forcing mechanism (wind or currents) are used as inputs to Lagrangian models that include biological components (such as seed terminal velocity or larval vertical migration). These biophysical models are then used to simulate trajectories of the biological entities (seeds, larvae) in three dimensions. We reflect on these converging trends by first putting them into an historical perspective, and then by comparing the physical and biological processes represented in marine larva vs. terrestrial seed dispersal models, the data used for the models output corroboration, and the tools available to perform simulations. We conclude that this convergence offers the opportunity to bridge the gap between two scientific communities which are currently largely disconnected. More broadly, we also see our comparison across systems as a useful way to strengthen the links between aquatic and terrestrial ecology by sharing knowledge, methods, tools, and concepts.},

abstract = {Designing connected landscapes is among the most widespread strategies for achieving biodiversity conservation targets. The challenge lies in simultaneously satisfying the connectivity needs of multiple species at multiple spatial scales under uncertain climate and land-use change. To evaluate the contribution of remnant habitat fragments to the connectivity of regional habitat networks, we develop a framework integrating uncertainty in climate and land-use change projections with the latest developments in network connectivity research and spatial, multi-purpose conservation prioritization. We apply this framework to a set of fourteen vertebrate focal species in peri-urban Montreal, Canada. We show that accounting for connectivity in spatial prioritization strongly modifies conservation priorities, and that these priorities are robust to uncertain climate change. We use land-use change simulations to explore the robustness of species' habitat networks to alternative development scenarios. Setting conservation priorities based on habitat quality and connectivity maintains a large proportion of the region's connectivity despite anticipated habitat loss due to climate and land-use change. We found that the application of connectivity criteria alongside habitat quality criteria for protected-area design is area-efficient and does not necessarily amplify trade-offs among conservation criteria. Our approach and results are now being applied in and around the city of Montreal and are well suited to the design of ecological networks and green infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem services in other regions, in particular regions around large cities, where connectivity is critically low},

Analyses showed that ferric iron reduction with depth was broadly accompanied by manganese and arsenic reduction and FeS accumulation. Clone library analyses indicated the suboxic-anoxic transition zone sediment contained abundant Fe(III)- and sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, whereas the overlying surface sediment was dominated by clones related to the Fe(II)-oxidizing zetaproteobacterium, Mariprofundus ferroxydans. Cultures obtained from the transition zone were enriched in bacteria that reduced Fe(III), nitrate, sulfate and As(V) using acetate or lactate as electron donors. In the absence of added organic carbon, bacteria were enriched that oxidized Fe(II) anaerobically or microaerobically, sulfide microaerobically and aerobically and As(III) aerobically. According to 16S rRNA gene analyses, enriched bacteria represented a phylogenetically wide distribution. Most probable number counts indicated an abundance of nitrate-, As(V)- and Fe(III)((s,aq))-reducers, and dissolved sulfide-oxidizers over sulfate-reducers, and FeS-, As(III)- and nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidisers in the transition zone. It is noteworthy that the combined community and geochemical data imply near-surface microbial iron and arsenic redox cycling were dominant biogeochemical processes.},

abstract = {The rate of exchange, or connectivity, among populations effects their ability to recover after disturbance events. However, there is limited information on the extent to which populations are connected or how multiple disturbances affect connectivity, especially in coastal and marine ecosystems. We used network analysis and the outputs of a biophysical model to measure potential functional connectivity and predict the impact of multiple disturbances on seagrasses in the central Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Australia. The seagrass networks were densely connected, indicating that as modelled seagrasses are resilient to the random loss of meadows. Our analysis identified discrete meadows that are important sources of seagrass propagules and that serve as stepping stones connecting various different parts of the network. Several of these meadows were close to urban areas or ports and likely to be at risk from coastal development. Deep water meadows were highly connected to coastal meadows and may function as a refuge, but only for non-foundation species. We evaluated changes to the structure and functioning of the seagrass networks when one or more discrete meadows were removed due to multiple disturbance events. The scale of disturbance required to disconnect the seagrass networks into two or more components was on average {\textgreater} 245 kilometres; about half the length of the metapopulation. The densely connected seagrass meadows of the central GBRWHA are not limited by the supply of propagules, therefore management should focus on improving environmental conditions that support natural seagrass recruitment and recovery processes. Our study provides a new framework for assessing the impact of global change on the connectivity and persistence of coastal and marine ecosystems. Without this knowledge, management actions, including coastal restoration, may prove unnecessary and be unsuccessful.

abstract = {Warming occurs particularly fast in the Arctic and exerts profound effects on arctic ecosystems. Sea ice-associated ecosystems are projected to decline but reduced arctic sea ice cover also increases the solar radiation reaching the coastal seafloors with the potential for expansion of vegetated habitats, i.e., kelp forests and seagrass meadows. These habitats support key ecosystem functions, some of which may mitigate effects of climate change. Therefore, the likely expansion of vegetated coastal habitats in the Arctic will generate new productive ecosystems, offer habitat for a number of invertebrate and vertebrate species, including provision of refugia for calcifiers from possible threats from ocean acidification, contribute to enhance CO2 sequestration and protect the shoreline from erosion. The development of models allowing quantitative forecasts of the future of vegetated arctic ecosystems requires that key hypotheses underlying such forecasts be tested. Here we propose a set of three key testable hypotheses along with a research agenda for testing them using a broad diversity of approaches, including analyses of paleo-records, space-for-time substitutions and experimental studies. The research agenda proposed would provide a solid underpinning to guide forecasts on the spread of marine macrophytes onto the Arctic with climate change and contribute to balance our understanding of climate change impacts on the arctic ecosystem through a focus on the role of engineering species. Anticipating these changes in ecosystem structure and function is key to develop managerial strategies to maximize these ecosystem services in a future warmer Arctic.},

We propose an innovative approach, combining biophysical modeling with a routinely-used tool for marine-reserve design (Marxan), to address both challenges by using ecologically-informed connectivity parameters. We showed how functional demographic connectivity for four candidate reef-associated species with varying dispersal abilities and a suite of connectivity metrics weighted by habitat quality can be used to set conservation objectives and inform MPA placement. Overall, the strength of dispersal barriers varied across modeled species and, also across species, we found a lack of spatial concordance of reefs that were high-quality sources, self-persistent, and stepping-stones. Including spatially-heterogeneous habitat quality made a considerable difference to connectivity patterns, significantly reducing the potential reproductive output from many reefs. We also found that caution is needed in combining connectivity data from modeled species into multi-species matrices, which do not perform reliably as surrogates for all connectivity metrics of individual species. We then showed that restricting the habitat available for conservation has an inequitable impact on different connectivity objectives and species, with greatest impact on betweenness centrality and long-distance dispersers. We used Brazilian coral reefs as a case study but our approach is applicable to both marine and terrestrial conservation planning, and offers a holistic way to design functionally-connected reserves to tackle the complex issues relevant to planning for persistence.},

abstract = {The planktonic larvae of many coastal marine invertebrates swim vertically during dispersal to exploit variation in current strength and direction, food abundance and mortality rate throughout the water column and offshore. Prior studies have estimated the effects of vertical swimming upon larval dispersal using mathematical models. However, most such studies consider just a small number of predefined swimming behaviors despite evidence that even seemingly insignificant changes to these behaviors can dramatically alter predictions of larval delivery. Additionally, the concurrent effects of vertical swimming upon predation risk, feeding opportunities and energy budgeting are not well characterized. We used a simple mathematical model of larval dispersal in upwelling-favorable conditions to investigate how a continuum of swimming behaviors affect these quantities simultaneously. Within this continuum, we identified two categories of successful behaviors. ‘Mean-onshore' behaviors deliver most larvae to coastal habitats, but offer limited opportunities for feeding and alongshore movement during dispersal. By contrast, ‘mean-offshore' behaviors deliver fewer larvae to shore, but permit more feeding, alongshore movement, and, potentially, safety from nearshore hazards. No behaviors considered achieved the benefits of both categories. We hypothesize that mean-onshore behaviors are advantageous for species with non-feeding larvae or sparse adult populations, while mean-offshore behaviors are advantageous for species with feeding larvae or crowded adult populations. Our results underscore the importance of considering how behavior interacts with environmental structure and individual biology while studying dispersal in marine and other ecosystems.},

There has been rapid progress to meet the quantitative goal (the 10{\%} target). However, the qualitative aspects of Aichi target 11 are less well described. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development” reaffirms the quantitative element of Aichi target 11, and, through the described sub-targets, places further emphasis on the economic and social context of global development. The complexity of the language from Aichi target 11 is not mirrored in SDG 14, leading to a potential scenario where the knowledge and progress towards Aichi Target 11 will be diluted as the focus shifts to the SDGs. This paper presents current knowledge and implementation of the qualitative elements of Aichi Target 11 and highlights gaps in knowledge. We conclude that the progress made so far on describing and implementing the qualitative goals of Aichi Target 11 should be integrated into SDG 14 in order to strengthen global efforts for marine biodiversity conservation and support the broader vision for sustainable development that will “transform our world”.},

The effects of three levels of non-native Daphnia lumholtzi propagule pressure on establishment success, community structure, and ecosystem attributes were evaluated in native zooplankton communities connected by species dispersal versus unconnected communities, and relative to a control without native species. Establishment of the non-native species exhibited a propagule dose-dependent relationship with high levels of propagule pressure resulting in the greatest establishment success. Native community connectivity, however, effectively reduced establishment at the low level of propagule pressure and further augmented native species richness across propagule pressure treatments. Propagule pressure largely determined the negative impacts of the non-native species on native species richness, native biomass, and edible producer biomass. The results highlight that native community connectivity can reduce invasion success at a low propagule dose and decrease extinction risk of native competitors, but high propagule pressure can overcome connectivity-mediated biotic resistance to influence establishment and impact of the non-native species. Together, the results emphasize the importance of the interaction of propagule pressure and community connectivity as a regulator of invasion success, and argue for the maintenance of metacommunity connectivity to confer invasion resistance.

abstract = {Many complex networks show signs of modular structure, uncovered by community detection. Although many methods succeed in revealing various partitions, it remains difficult to detect at what scale some partition is significant. This problem shows foremost in multi-resolution methods. We here introduce an efficient method for scanning for resolutions in one such method. Additionally, we introduce the notion of "significance" of a partition, based on subgraph probabilities. Significance is independent of the exact method used, so could also be applied in other methods, and can be interpreted as the gain in encoding a graph by making use of a partition. Using significance, we can determine "good" resolution parameters, which we demonstrate on benchmark networks. Moreover, optimizing significance itself also shows excellent performance. We demonstrate our method on voting data from the European Parliament. Our analysis suggests the European Parliament has become increasingly ideologically divided and that nationality plays no role.},

abstract = {It is hypothesized that the spatio-temporal variability in larval supply is caused by multiple bio-physical drivers that correlate with the occurrence of ‘recruitment pulses', which influences the recovery potential of coral reefs following large-scale disturbances. Here, we used a larval dispersal model to explore coral larvae dispersal patterns under variable oceanographic conditions, densities of parental colonies, and taxa-specific differences in the biology of propagules. Model predictions were validated with observed settlement and recruitment data to test the robustness of larval dispersal modelling for forecasting the recovery potential of the study reefs. The model was applied to the Western Pacific archipelago of Palau during three years before and after major typhoon disturbances, and simulations were run and validated for two major broadcast-spawning reef-building taxa: Acropora and Porites. Investigations into the relative role of physical (currents, wind, waves) and biological (taxa, disturbance impact) parameters on overall larval supply show that low wind speeds and the intermittent occurrence of north and south-west oceanic currents contributed significantly to enhancing larval supply at the scale of the archipelago. The reduced parental colony densities on the eastern reefs following the disturbances did not have a major impact on predicted larval supply patterns. Relatively low larval supply to most of the disturbed eastern reefs are predicted during the most common oceanographic conditions, forecasting a low recovery potential through larval recruitment. Mapping the spatio-temporal dynamics of larval supply and identifying dispersal barriers from intact to disturbed reefs can help predict recovery patterns across reef communities.},

Wind-driven upwelling events deliver cold nutrient-rich water to coastlines, supporting highly productive marine environments. Results from studies comparing ecological processes across upwelling regimes are mixed: some reveal weaker herbivory in upwelling regions, while others report a positive relationship between upwelling and herbivory. In this synthesis we examine the influence of upwelling on top-down control of producers across the globe. Location: Global; marine ecosystems. Time period: 1978–2017. Major taxa studied: Marine herbivores and algae. Methods: We used data from herbivory studies focusing specifically on the influence of upwelling activity (upwelling studies), and a broader collection of herbivore exclusion studies dating back four decades. For the upwelling studies we compared herbivore effects between experiments replicated across sites for which upwelling conditions were described by the authors. Meanwhile, for the broader collection of experiments we used externally sourced oceanographic data to characterize upwelling activity, and examined how herbivory changed along a gradient of upwelling activity. Results: Our results consistently reveal that upwelling weakens herbivore effects on producers. Herbivory was, on average, four times weaker in upwelling sites relative to sites under weak upwelling or downwelling regimes in studies that specifically examined upwelling. The analysis of the broader herbivory literature revealed a similar weakening influence of upwelling on herbivory; however, the effect size was smaller and varied across producer functional groups. Main conclusions: Nutrient subsidies from upwelling events reduce top-down control by herbivores in coastal ecosystems; however, the negative relationship between upwelling intensity and herbivory is likely the result of a combination of co-occurring processes. First, increased primary production overwhelms consumption by herbivores. Second, cold water reduces herbivore metabolism and activity. Finally, surface currents associated with upwelling activity transport herbivore larvae offshore, decoupling secondary production from herbivory.},

The outputs from this study show the valuable input when allocating space to activities and uses in the marine realm supporting the planning process in the development of management alternatives. This case study also illustrates how ecological goals can be better included to contribute to the Maritime Planning process in Portugal. Systematic planning can be applied to support the connection between Marine Strategy Framework and Maritime Spatial Planning European Directives.

Colonies rafting on broken eelgrass traveled over 200 times farther and had comparable recruitment success relative to swimming larvae. The recruitment of rafting colonies into new habitats was facilitated by the ability of thesecolonial animals to grow asexually onto surrounding substrata. Rafting colonies brooded larvae that were subsequently relased after the colony settled into a new habitat. These results suggest that colonization of new habitats can occur by post-larvae as well as larvae, and that long-range dispersal by species with short-lived larvae may occur by post-larval rafting.},

In the results of such models, larval duration, mortality, and behavior in the water column have exhibited pronounced effects on larval dis- persal of marine benthic invertebrates. The parameterization of these processes has broadly reflected values from labo- ratory experiments, but the accuracy of these values is unknown. The pelagic larval duration used in models should be determined by laboratory, or preferably field, studies and should incorporate environmentally dependent variability. For mortality, in situ estimates are now feasible and, likely, more accurate than the currently used values. Larval behav- ior can be measured in the field, by high-frequency sam- pling of distributional changes relative to features in the water column or by controlled larval releases in tractable systems. To successfully validate the outcomes of these models, we must either improve our techniques for measur- ing larval abundance at the end of larval transport immedi- ately before settlement, or incorporate components for set- tlement into the models. We must also address the mismatch in sampling resolution between biological and physical pro- cesses.

Ev-idence from direct and indirect approaches using geochemical and genetic techniques suggests that populations range from fully open to fully closed. Understanding the biophysical processes that contribute to observed disper-sal patterns requires integrated interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate high-resolution biophysical modeling and empirical data.

These structures become colonised by sedentary organisms and non-migratory reef fish, and form local ecosystems that attract larger predators including seals, birds, and fish. It is possible that these structures form a system of interconnected reef environments through the planktonic dispersal of the pelagic stages of organisms by ocean currents. Changes to the overall arrangement of hard substrate areas through removal or addition of individual man-made structures will affect the interconnectivity and could impact on the ecosystem. Here, we assessed the connectivity of sectors with oil and gas structures, wind farms, wrecks, and natural hard substrate, using a model that simulates the drift of planktonic stages of seven organisms with sedentary adult stages associated with hard substrate, applied to the period 2001–2010. Connectivity was assessed using a classification system designed to address the function of sectors in the network. Results showed a relatively stable overall spatial distribution of sector function but with distinct variations between species and years. The results are discussed in the context of decommissioning of oil and gas infrastructure in the North Sea.},

abstract = {Connectivity is a central concept in ecology, wildlife management, and conservation science. Understanding the role of connectivity in determining species persistence is increasingly important in the face of escalating anthropogenic impacts on climate and habitat. These connectivity augmenting processes can severely impact species distributions and community and ecosystem functioning. One general definition of connectivity is that it is an emergent process arising from a set of spatial interdependencies between individuals or populations, and increasingly realistic representations of connectivity are being sought. Generally, connectivity consists of a structural component, relating to the distribution of suitable and unsuitable habitat, and a functional component, relating to movement behavior, yet the interaction of both components often better describes ecological processes. Additionally, although implied by ‘movement', demographic measures such as the occurrence or abundance of organisms are regularly overlooked when quantifying connectivity. Integrating such demographic contributions based on the knowledge of species distribution patterns is critical to understanding the dynamics of spatially structured populations. Demographically-informed connectivity draws from fundamental concepts in metapopulation ecology while maintaining important conceptual developments from landscape ecology, and the methodological development of spatially-explicit hierarchical statistical models that have the potential to overcome modeling and data challenges. Together, this offers a promising framework for developing ecologically realistic connectivity metrics. This review synthesizes existing approaches for quantifying connectivity and advocates for demographically-informed connectivity as a general framework for addressing current problems across ecological fields reliant on connectivity-driven processes such as population ecology, conservation biology and landscape ecology. Using supporting simulations to highlight the consequences of commonly made assumptions that overlook important demographic contributions, we show that even small amounts of demographic information can greatly improve model performance. Ultimately, we argue demographic measures are central to extending the concept of connectivity and resolves long-standing challenges associated with accurately quantifying the influence of connectivity on fundamental ecological processes.},

However, the many possible approaches and techniques for model selection, and the conflicting recommendations for their use, can be confusing. We contend that much confusion surrounding statistical model selection results from failing to first clearly specify the purpose of the analysis. We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a critical defense against biodiversity loss in the world's oceans, but to realize near-term conservation benefits, they must be established where major threats to biodiversity occur and can be mitigated. We quantified the degree to which MPA establishment has targeted stoppable threats (i.e., threats that can be abated through effectively managed MPAs alone) by combining spatially explicit marine biodiversity threat data in 2008 and 2013 and information on the location and potential of MPAs to halt threats. We calculated an impact metric to determine whether countries are protecting proportionally more high- or low-threat ecoregions and compared observed values with random protected- area allocation. We found that protection covered {\textless}2{\%} of ecoregions in national waters with high levels of abatable threat in 2013, which is {\ss}59{\%} less protection in high-threat areas than if MPAs had been placed randomly. Relatively low-threat ecoregions had 6.3 times more strict protection (International Union for Conservation of Nature categories I–II) than high-threat ecoregions. Thirty-one ecoregions had high levels of stoppable threat but very low protection, which presents opportunities for MPAs to yield more significant near-term conservation benefits. The extent of the global MPA estate has increased, but the establishment of MPAs where they can reduce threats that are driving biodiversity loss is now urgently needed.},

We use network-theory tools to analyze the flow network and gain insights into transport processes. In particular, we quantitatively relate dispersion and mixing characteristics, classically quantified by Lyapunov exponents, to the degree of the network nodes. A family of network entropies is defined from the network adjacency matrix and related to the statistics of stretching in the fluid, in particular, to the Lyapunov exponent field. Finally, we use a network community detection algorithm, Infomap, to partition the Mediterranean network into coherent regions, i.e., areas internally well mixed, but with little fluid interchange between them.},

abstract = {Climate and land-use changes will require species to move large distances following shifts in their suitable habitats, which will frequently involve traversing intensively human-modified landscapes. Practitioners will therefore need to evaluate and act to enhance the degree to which habitat patches scattered throughout the landscape may function as stepping stones facilitating dispersal among otherwise isolated habitat areas. We formulate a new generalized network model of habitat connectivity that accounts for the number of dispersing individuals and for long-distance dispersal processes across generations. By doing so, we bridge the gap between complex dynamic population models, which are generally too data demanding and hence difficult to apply in practical wide-scale decision-making, and simpler static connectivity models that only consider the amount of habitat that can be reached by a single average disperser during its life span. We find that the loss of intermediate and sufficiently large stepping-stone habitat patches can cause a sharp decline in the distance that can be traversed by species (critical spatial thresholds) that cannot be effectively compensated by other factors previously regarded as crucial for long-distance dispersal (fat-tailed dispersal kernels, source population size). We corroborate our findings by showing that our model largely outperforms previous connectivity models in explaining the large-scale range expansion of a forest bird species, the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius, over a 20-year period. The capacity of species to exploit the opportunities created by networks of stepping-stone patches largely depends on species-specific life-history traits, suggesting that species assemblages traversing fragmented landscapes may be exposed to a spatial filtering process driving long-term changes in community composition. Synthesis and applications. Previous static connectivity models seriously underestimate the importance of stepping-stone patches in sustaining rare but crucial dispersal events. We provide a conceptually broader model that shows that stepping stones (i) must be of sufficient size to be of conservation value, (ii) are particularly crucial for the spread of species (either native or invasive) or genotypes over long distances and (iii) can effectively reduce the isolation of the largest habitat blocks in reserves, therefore largely contributing to species persistence across wide spatial and temporal scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {Herbivore communities can be sensitive to changes in predator pressure (top-down effects) and resource availability (bottom-up effects) in a wide range of systems. However, it remains unclear whether such top-down and bottom-up effects reflect direct impacts of predators and/or resources on herbivores, or are indirect, reflecting altered interactions among herbivore species. We quantified direct and indirect effects of bottom-up and top-down processes on an eelgrass (Zostera marina) herbivore assemblage. In a field experiment, we factorially manipulated water column nutrients (with Osmocote{\textless}sup{\textgreater}™{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} slow-release fertilizer) and predation pressure (with predator exclusion cages) and measured the effects on herbivore abundance, richness and beta diversity. We examined likely mechanisms of community responses by statistically exploring the response of individual herbivore species to trophic manipulations. Predators increased herbivore richness and total abundance, in both cases through indirect shifts in community composition. Increases in richness occurred through predator suppression of common gammarid amphipod species (Monocorophium acherusicum and Photis brevipes), permitting the inclusion of rarer gammarid species (Aoroides columbiae and Pontogeneia rostrata). Increased total herbivore abundance reflected increased abundance of a caprellid amphipod species (Caprella sp.), concurrent with declines in the abundance of other common species. Furthermore, predators decreased beta diversity by decreasing variability in Caprella sp. abundance among habitat patches. Osmocote{\textless}sup{\textgreater}™{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} fertilization increased nutrient concentrations locally, but nutrients dissipated to background levels within 3 m of the fertilizer. Nutrient addition weakly affected the herbivore assemblage, not affecting richness and increasing total abundance by increasing one herbivore species (Caprella sp.). Nutrient addition did not affect beta diversity. We demonstrated that assemblage-level effects of trophic manipulations on community structure are the result of distinct and often indirect responses of herbivore species. These results underscore the importance of understanding herbivore-herbivore interactions in a system commonly subjected to both eutrophication and overfishing.},

Here, we unite 30 consecutive years of watershed modeling, biogeochemical data, and comprehensive aerial surveys of Chesapeake Bay, United States to quantify the cascading effects of anthropogenic impacts on submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), an ecologically and economically valuable habitat. We employ structural equation models to link land use change to higher nutrient loads, which in turn reduce SAV cover through multiple, independent pathways. We also show through our models that high biodiversity of SAV consistently promotes cover, an unexpected finding that corroborates emerging evidence from other terrestrial and marine systems. Due to sustained management actions that have reduced nitrogen concentrations in Chesapeake Bay by 23{\%} since 1984, SAV has regained 17,000 ha to achieve its highest cover in almost half a century. Our study empirically demonstrates that nutrient reductions and biodiversity conservation are effective strategies to aid the successful recovery of degraded systems at regional scales, a finding which is highly relevant to the utility of environmental management programs worldwide.},

abstract = {1. The inherent complexity of high‐diversity systems can make them particularly dif- ficult to understand. The relatively recent introduction of functional approaches, which seek to infer ecosystem functioning based on species' ecological traits, has revolutionized our understanding of these high-diversity systems. Today, the functional structure of an assemblage is widely regarded as a key indicator of the status or resilience of an ecosystem. Indeed, functional evaluations have become a mainstay of monitoring and management approaches. But is the heavy focus on broad metrics of functional structure grounded in empirical research? 2. On tropical coral reefs, the ocean's most diverse ecosystems, remarkably few studies directly quantify ecosystem functions and the term ‘function' is widely used but rarely defined, especially when applied to reef fishes. Our review sug- gests that most ‘functional' studies do not study function as it relates to ecological processes. Rather, they look at easy‐to‐measure traits or proxies that are thought to have functional significance. However, these links are rarely tested empirically, severely limiting our capacity to extend results from community structure to the dynamic processes operating within high‐diversity ecosystems such as coral reefs. 3. With rapid changes in global ecosystems, and in their capacity to deliver ecosys- tem services, there is an urgent need to understand and empirically measure the role of organisms in various ecosystem functions. We suggest that if we are to understand and manage transitioning coral reefs in the Anthropocene, a broad definition of the word ‘function' is needed along with a focus on ecological pro- cesses and the empirical quantification of functional roles. 4. In this review, we propose a universal operational definition of the term ‘function' that works from a cellular to a global level. Specifically, it is the movement or storage of energy or material. Within this broad definitional framework, all functions are part of a continuum that is tied together by the process‐based unifier of material fluxes. With this universal definition at hand, we then present a path forward that will allow us to fully harness the power of functional approaches in understanding and managing high-diversity systems such as coral reefs.},

However, existing reserves and national parks are unlikely to incorporate the long-term and large-scale dynamics of ecosystems. Hence, conservation strategies have to actively incorporate the large areas of land that are managed for human use. For ecosystems to reorganize after large-scale natural and human-induced disturbances, spatial resilience in the form of ecological memory is a prerequisite. The ecological memory is composed of the species, interactions and structures that make ecosystem reorganization possible, and its components may be found within disturbed patches as well in the surrounding landscape. Present static reserves should be complemented with dynamic reserves, such as ecological fallows and dynamic successional reserves, that are part of ecosystem management mimicking natural disturbance regimes at the landscape level.},

abstract = {The abundant-centre hypothesis (ACH) predicts that the abundance of a species should be highest at the centre of its geographic range and decline towards the edges (Brown 1984). Mart{\'{i}}nez et al. (2017) set out to test this hypothesis with published records of specimens assigned to the cirolanid iso-pod species Excirolana braziliensis, assuming it constituted a widespread species distributed in tropical and subtropical sandy beaches of the American continent along both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. They analyzed geographic patterns of abundance for this isopod across its presumed distribution range from both published studies and their own data for 77 sandy beaches in the Atlantic and 62 in the Pacific. They inferred support for the ACH in the Pacific, but not the Atlantic. We argue, however, that inferences about support or lack thereof for the ACH in their study are not valid, because a key assumption of the test, i.e. that the records examined represent a single species, was violated. The primary basis for our critique is the well-documented cryptic diversity within E. braziliensis (see below). A secondary weakness of the Mart{\'{i}}nez et al. (2017) study is that E. braziliensis has been commonly confused in ecological literature with the closely related nominal taxa E. mayana and E. chamensis, which have overlapping distributions (Brusca et al. 1995). Therefore, some of the records examined by Mart{\'{i}}nez et al. (2017) may have been incorrectly assigned to E. braziliensis. ABSTRACT: Despite ample evidence indicating that Excirolana braziliensis corresponds to a species complex, Mart{\'{i}}nez et al. (2017; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 583:137−148) considered this isopod as a single species with a wide distribution along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the Americas, to evaluate the abundant-centre hypothesis (ACH). Multiple studies, however, have documented the presence of highly divergent lineages within this isopod, some of which may have separated millions of years ago, and with morphological differences reported among some of the lineages. The assumption of a single widespread species has led to misleading inferences regarding the underlying causes of ecological variation in this isopod, as indicated in recent phylogeographic studies. Therefore, it is surprising that a new macroecological study is considering E. braziliensis as a single widespread species again. The cost of ignoring its cryptic diversity is that the Mart{\'{i}}nez et al. (2017) study does not really contribute to our understanding of the ACH.},

abstract = {Habitat loss fragments metacommunities, altering the movement of species between previously connected habitat patches. The consequences of habitat loss for ecosystem functioning depend, in part, on how these changes in connectivity alter the spatial insurance effects of biodiversity. Spatial insurance is the maintenance of biodiversity and stable ecosystem functioning in changing environments that occurs when species are able to move between local habitat patches in order to track conditions to which they are adapted. Spatial insurance requires a combination of species sorting dynamics, which allow species to disperse to habitats where they are productive, and mass effect dynamics, where dispersal allows species to persist in marginal habitats where environmental conditions do not support growth. Here we use a spatially explicit metacommunity model to show that the relative contribution of species sorting and mass effects to spatial insurance changes with the rate of dispersal. We then simulate different sequences of habitat loss by removing habitat patches based on their betweenness centrality (the degree to which a patch serves as a connection between other patches in the metacommunity). We demonstrate that the sequence of habitat loss has a large, nonlinear impact on diversity, ecosystem functioning and stability. Spatial insurance is lost because habitat fragmentation impedes species sorting, while promoting mass effects and dispersal limitation. We find that species sorting dynamics, and thus spatial insurance, are most robust to the removal of habitat patches with low betweenness centrality. These findings advance our understanding of how habitat connectivity facilitates the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and may prove useful for design of habitat networks.},

In some cases when resilience is exceeded, relatively small linear changes in stressors can cause relatively abrupt and nonlinear changes in ecosystems. Ecological regime shifts occur when resilience is exceeded and ecosystems enter a new local equilibrium that differs in its structure and function from the previous state. Ecological resilience, the amount of disturbance that a system can withstand before it shifts into an alternative stability domain, is an important framework for understanding and managing ecological systems subject to collapse and reorganization. Recently, interest in the influence of spatial characteristics of landscapes on resilience has increased. Understanding how spatial structure and variation in relevant variables in landscapes affects resilience to disturbance will assist with resilience quantification, and with local and regional management.

abstract = {Thermal stress is expected to compromise the persistence of tropical corals throughout their biogeographic ranges, making many reefs inhospitable to corals by the end of the century. We integrated models of local predictions of thermal stress throughout the coming century, coral larval dispersal, and the persistence of a coral's metapopulation(s) in the Caribbean to investigate broad trends in metapopulation fragmentation and decline. As coral reef patches become inhospitable throughout the next century, the metapopulation of Orbicella annularis is predicted to fragment, with sub-networks centered around highly connected patches and thermal refuges. Some of these are predicted to include the reefs of Colombia, Panama, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Southern and Northern Cuba, Haiti, and the Bahamas. Unknown coral population demographic parameters, such as lifetime egg production and stock-recruitment rates, limit the model's predictions; however, a sensitivity analysis demonstrates that broadscale patterns of fragmentation and metapopulation collapse before the end of the century are consistent across a range of potential parameterizations. Despite dire predictions, the model highlights the potential value in protecting and restoring coral populations at strategic locations that are highly connected and/or influential to persistence. Coordinated conservation activities that support local resilience at low coral cover have the potential to stave off metapopulation collapse for decades, buying valuable time. Thermal refuges are linchpins of metapopulation persistence during moderate thermal stress, and targeted conservation or restoration that supports connectivity between these refuges by enhancing local population growth or sexual propagation may be critically important to species conservation on coral reefs.},

We review how beta-diversity is impacted by human activities, including farming, selective logging, urbanization, species invasions, overhunting, and climate change. Beta-diversity increases, decreases, or remains unchanged by these impacts, depending on the balance of processes that cause species composition to become more different (biotic heterogenization) or more similar (biotic homogenization) between sites.

abstract = {New observations in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada show that temperature and dissolved oxygen have a pronounced seasonal cycle, with a spatially varying phase. Phase lags in oscillating systems arise due to internal time scales which can be interpreted in fluid systems as residence times. Exploiting phase we construct a quantitative and internally consistent circulation scheme for this body of water after dividing it into four regions: the Fraser River plume, the surface waters down to 50 m, the intermediate waters down to 200 m, and the deep water. In this scheme the intermediate water, the largest region by volume, is continually renewed, and its characteristics change in response to continuous changes in the characteristics of source waters. The dependence of the estuarine circulation on variations in fresh inflow is weak. The deep water is volumetrically less important, but seasonal changes in the density of oceanic source waters can produce a variation in the overall circulation by driving an additional inflow which leads to both deep renewal and increased upwelling. In turn, this increased upwelling results in lower surface temperatures than might otherwise be expected. Intermediate water residence times are about 160 days. Deep water is renewed once per year in summer and is affected only by vertical diffusion during the rest of the year. Surface water residence times for the entire Strait are afew months at most, but the Fraser Riverplume has a freshwater residence time of approximately 1 day. In addition, we find that the residence time of oceanic source waters in the Strait is 1.7 years due to a substantial recirculation in Haro Strait. Other consequences of this scheme are consistent with independent estimates of horizontal transports, air-sea heat fluxes, subsurface oxygen (O2) utilization, and primary production. Finally, analysis of the spatial phase variations suggests that the intermediate inflow enters the Strait as a boundary current along the slopes of the Fraser delta.},

Larval dispersal is an important ecological process of great interest to conservation and the establishment of marine protected areas. Increasing numbers of studies are turning to biophysical models to simulate dispersal patterns, including in the deep-sea, but for many ecologists unassisted by a physical oceanographer, a model can present as a black box. Sensitivity testing offers a means to test the models' abilities and limitations and is a starting point for all modelling efforts. The aim of this study is to illustrate a sensitivity testing process for the unassisted ecologist, through a deep-sea case study example, and demonstrate how sensitivity testing can be used to determine optimal model settings, assess model adequacy, and inform ecological interpretation of model outputs. Five input parameters are tested (timestep of particle simulator (TS), horizontal (HS) and vertical separation (VS) of release points, release frequency (RF), and temporal range (TR) of simulations) using a commonly employed pairing of models. The procedures used are relevant to all marine larval dispersal models. It is shown how the results of these tests can inform the future set up and interpretation of ecological studies in this area. For example, an optimal arrangement of release locations spanning a release area could be deduced; the increased depth range spanned in deep-sea studies may necessitate the stratification of dispersal simulations with different numbers of release locations at different depths; no fewer than 52 releases per year should be used unless biologically informed; three years of simulations chosen based on climatic extremes may provide results with 90{\%} similarity to five years of simulation; and this model setup is not appropriate for simulating rare dispersal events. A step-by-step process, summarising advice on the sensitivity testing procedure, is provided to inform all future unassisted ecologists looking to run a larval dispersal simulation.},

abstract = {The geographic distributions of marine species are changing rapidly, with leading range edges following climate poleward, deeper, and in other directions and trailing range edges often contracting in similar directions. These shifts have their roots in fine-scale interactions between organisms and their environment-including mosaics and gradients of temperature and oxygen-mediated by physiology, behavior, evolution, dispersal, and species interactions. These shifts reassemble food webs and can have dramatic consequences. Compared with species on land, marine species are more sensitive to changing climate but have a greater capacity for colonization. These differences suggest that species cope with climate change at different spatial scales in the two realms and that range shifts across wide spatial scales are a key mechanism at sea. Additional research is needed to understand how processes interact to promote or constrain range shifts, how the dominant responses vary among species, and how the emergent communities of the future ocean will function.},

@article{Harwell2002,
abstract = {Plant populations have long been noted to migrate faster than predicted based on their life history and seed dispersal characteristics (i.e., Reid's paradox of rapid plant migration). Although precise mechanisms to account for such phenomena are not fully known for all plant species, a combination of theoretical and empirically driven mechanisms often resolves this paradox. Here, we couple a series of direct and indirect field and laboratory exercises on one marine macrophyte, Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), to measured distances between new patches and established beds in order to elucidate the long-distance dispersal and colonization potential of this marine seagrass. Detached, floating reproductive shoots with mature seeds were found to remain positively buoyant for up to 2 wk and retain mature seeds for up to 3 wk before release under laboratory conditions. Analysis of the detritus wrack along a remote shoreline found reproductive fragments with viable seeds up to 34 km from established, natural beds. Analysis of different regions of the Chesapeake Bay and coastal bays of the Delmarva Peninsula that once supported eelgrass populations, revealed natural patches at 13 sites ranging from 1 to 108 km from established populations. A combination of tidal currents and wind influences has the potential to move a passive particle at the surface (e.g., a floating reproductive fragment) up to 23 km in a 6-h tidal window suggesting that most unvegetated areas in this region that can support eelgrass are within the colonization potential envelope. We suggest that, when combined with earlier work on seed dispersal ecology of this species, eelgrass has strong qualities for high colonization potential of new habitat. The finding of natural patches at such great distances from established beds when studied in the context of the dispersal mechanism (currents and wind) make the dispersal distances of this species one of the highest for angiosperms, comparable in scale to mangroves and coconuts. This new understanding of the dispersal dynamics of eelgrass is critical in the context of seagrass restoration in areas distant from established beds, maintenance of existing populations threatened by anthropogenic inputs of sediments and nutrients, and examining metapopulation concepts in seagrass ecology.},

abstract = {Although the effects of variation between individuals within species are traditionally ignored in studies of species coexistence, the magnitude of intraspecific variation in nature is forcing ecologists to reconsider. Compelling intuitive arguments suggest that individual variation may provide a previously unrecognised route to diversity maintenance by blurring species-level competitive differences or substituting for species-level niche differences. These arguments, which are motivating a large body of empirical work, have rarely been evaluated with quantitative theory. Here we incorporate intraspecific variation into a common model of competition and identify three pathways by which this variation affects coexistence: (1) changes in competitive dynamics because of nonlinear averaging, (2) changes in species' mean interaction strengths because of variation in underlying traits (also via nonlinear averaging) and (3) effects on stochastic demography. As a consequence of the first two mechanisms, we find that intraspecific variation in competitive ability increases the dominance of superior competitors, and intraspecific niche variation reduces species-level niche differentiation, both of which make coexistence more difficult. In addition, individual variation can exacerbate the effects of demographic stochasticity, and this further destabilises coexistence. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for emerging empirical interests in the effects of intraspecific variation on species diversity.},

         {\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding how species are distributed in the environment is increasingly important
            for natural resource management, particularly for keystone and habitat forming species,
            and those of conservation concern. Habitat suitability models are fundamental to developing
            this understanding; however their use in management continues to be limited due to
            often‐vague model objectives and inadequate evaluation methods. Along the Northeast
            Pacific coast, canopy kelps (Macrocystis pyrifera and Nereocystis luetkeana) provide
            biogenic habitat and considerable primary production to nearshore ecosystems. We investigated
            the distribution of these species by examining a series of increasingly complex habitat
            suitability models ranging from process‐based models based on species' ecology to
            complex Generalised Additive Models applied to purpose‐collected survey data. Seeking
            limits on model complexity, we explored the relationship between model complexity
            and forecast skill, measured using both cross‐validation and independent data evaluation.
            Our analysis confirmed the importance of predictors used in models of coastal kelp
            distributions developed elsewhere (i.e., depth, bottom type, bottom slope, and exposure);
            it also identified additional important factors including salinity, and interactions
            between exposure and salinity, and slope and tidal energy. Comparative results showed
            that cross‐validation can lead to over‐fitting, while independent data evaluation
            clearly identified the appropriate model complexity for generating habitat forecasts.
            Our results also illustrate that, depending on the evaluation data, predictions from
            simpler models can out‐perform those from more complex models. Collectively, the insights
            from evaluating multiple models with multiple data sets contribute to the holistic
            assessment of model forecast skill. The continued development of methods and metrics
            for evaluating model forecasts with independent data, and the explicit consideration
            of model objectives and assumptions, promise to increase the utility of model forecasts
            to decision makers.

abstract = {A major challenge in marine ecology is describing patterns of larval dispersal and population connectivity, as well as their underlying processes. We used a biophysical model to simulate dispersal of eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, larvae and connectivity among a network of 10 no-take reserves in a shallow, wind-driven estuary to assess the relative importance of spawning location, spawning date, larval behavior, larval mortality, and adult reproductive output to predicted dispersal and connectivity patterns. The location (i.e., natal reserve) and date of spawning relative to physical processes, particularly frequency of wind reversals, were the dominant drivers of dispersal and connectivity patterns. To a lesser extent, larval behavior (i.e., 3D vertical advection and ontogenetic depth regulation) and mortality modified dispersal and connectivity, whereas spatiotemporal variability in adult reproductive output was of minimal importance. Over a 21-day larval duration, mean dispersal distance of passive surface particles ranged from 5 to 40 km. Reserves were too small (1 km2) relative to mean dispersal distances to promote extensive local retention (median 2{\%}) and spaced too far apart (typically {\~{}}50 km) to promote extensive inter-reserve connectivity (median 2{\%}). Limited connectivity and local retention may preclude the network from being self-sustainable, thereby limiting its long-term conservation and management benefits. In reserve systems characterized by limited connectivity, management efforts should focus on increasing connectivity by increasing the number or size of reserves to realize the benefits of improved adult demographics within reserves.},

In order to understand what factors influence the distribution of glass sponges, patterns of distribution and abundance of reef and non-reef forming hexactinellids in fjords of British Columbia, Canada, were analyzed from photographs and transcripts recorded on dives undertaken by the 'Pisces IV' manned submersible during the 1980s. Hexactinellids are widely distributed throughout all fjords from 16 to 650 m depths, and in some fjords abundances reach 240 individuals in 10 m(2). In all fjords hexactinellids were most abundant at depths of 20 to 260 m, even where water depths exceeded 500 m. Glass sponges were rare in regions of inlets where oxygen levels fall below 2 ml l(-1), or in areas of high sediment deposition. Highest abundances coincided with water conditions of high dissolved silicate, low light, temperatures between 9 and 10degreesC and low suspended sediments. Extensive glass sponge skeletons in the inner basin of Howe Sound reflect past stress in this fjord that may include oxygen deficit, sediment loading from a mine and contamination from industrial sites. The observations from 'Pisces IV' suggest that glass sponges may be sentinel species for current and past seawater conditions in coastal British Columbia.},

abstract = {1. Maintaining habitat diversity and heterogeneity are key ecological elements of marine spatial planning. It is often assumed that patches of the same habitat harbour similar biological diversity. However, if habitat heterogeneity is high then the efficacy of habitats as surrogates of species diversity is weakened. 2. Beta diversity variation in fish assemblages in eelgrass meadows along the Pacific coast of Canada was analysed using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and tests for dispersion of homogeneity. Variations in species composition were examined at an inter-regional scale (100s of km apart) and an intra-regional scale (10s of km apart) over 7 years. Further, similarity percentage analysis and biological-environmental modelling were used to identify factors that differentiated among fish assemblages. Beta diversity turnover was also considered by examining for the decay in fish assemblage similarity across gradients in sea surface temperature, salinity, and physical distance between pairs-of-meadows using linear regression. 3. Patches of eelgrass meadows exhibited high fish assemblage dissimilarity at both the intra-regional and inter-regional scales; spatial factors accounted for substantially more variation in fish composition than temporal factors. A large number of fish species (2030) and different suites of environmental factors accounted for the observed high beta diversity variation. Fish composition similarity did not decay consistently within each region with physical distance between meadows or with a change of 1 degrees C in temperature, but Jaccard similarity did decay significantly within each region by 24{\%} per part per thousand change in salinity. 4. It is recommended that marine protected area planners consider the influence of freshwater flow into the coastal ocean and its subsequent impact on environmental gradients, which drives fish assemblage heterogeneity among eelgrass habitat patches.

abstract = {Recent functional trait studies have shown that trait differences may favour certain species (environmental filtering) while simultaneously preventing competitive exclusion (niche partitioning). However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology.},

abstract = {A latitudinal gradient in biodiversity has existed since before the time of the dinosaurs, yet how and why this gradient arose remains unresolved. Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.},

We also quantify the influence of species-specific connectivity estimates (i.e., larval dispersal vs. adult movement) on the marine-based SDMs outcomes. For illustration, seascape connectivity was modeled for two common, yet contrasting, marine species occurring in southeast Australian waters, the purple sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma , and the Australasian snapper, Chrysophrys auratus . Our models illustrate how different species-specific larval dispersal and adult movement can be efficiently accommodated. We used network-based centrality metrics to compute patch-level importance values and include these metrics in the group of predictors of correlative SDMs. We employed boosted regression trees (BRT) to fit our models, calculating the predictive performance, comparing spatial predictions and evaluating the relative influence of connectivity-based metrics among other predictors. Network-based metrics provide a flexible tool to quantify seascape connectivity that can be efficiently incorporated into SDMs. Connectivity across larval and adult stages was found to contribute to SDMs predictions and model performance was not negatively influenced from including these connectivity measures. Degree centrality, quantifying incoming and outgoing connections with habitat patches, was the most influential centrality metric. Pairwise interactions between predictors revealed that the species were predominantly found around hubs of connectivity and in warm, high-oxygenated, shallow waters. Additional research is needed to quantify the complex role that habitat network structure and temporal dynamics may have on SDM spatial predictions and explanatory power.},

Even if structural features in the matrix have a measurable effect on dispersal rates, this does not necessarily lead to significant increases in population viability. 3.Large and high-quality habitats provide source populations and locations for colonisation, so they are the main determinants of the capacity of species to shift their distributions in response to climate change because populations must be established successively in each new region. 4.Synthesis and applications.

For these reasons many different connectivity indices have been used or proposed for landscape conservation planning; however, their properties and behaviour have not been sufficiently examined and may provide misleading or undesired results for these purposes. We here present a new index (probability of connectivity, PC) that is based on the habitat availability concept, dispersal probabilities between habitat patches and graph structures. We evaluate the performance of PC and compare it with other widespread indices through a set of 13 relevant properties that an index should ideally fulfil for adequately integrating connectivity in landscape planning applications. We found that PC is the only index that systematically accomplished all the requirements, overcoming some serious limitations of other available indices. We encourage the use of PC as a sound basis for planning decision-making. To demonstrate the use and potential of PC for practical landscape applications, we present an example of application to a case study for the goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in Catalonia (NE Spain), where we identify those habitat areas that most contribute to overall landscape connectivity and evaluate the effectiveness and potential improvement of a protected areas network (Natura 2000) for conserving those critical habitat areas. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) is an important marine ecosystem in which concentrations of dissolved oxygen can reach hypoxic levels at certain times of the year. Although the general features of its oceanography are well understood, little is known in particular about the seasonal cycle of oxygen in shelf areas and its interannual variability. It is possible that high temporal resolution monitoring efforts could be carried out relatively easily in sheltered fjords adjacent to the shelf, but the linkages between conditions in these fjords and those on the shelf are also not known. Here a 10-year time series of monthly hydrographic stations in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, is used to identify the seasonal cycle of temperature, salinity, density, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll fluorescence in a WCVI fjord. Analysis suggests that there is a standard estuarine circulation in surface and near-surface waters of the Sound, as well as a deep renewal cycle in intermediate and deep waters, and that the two are largely independent. The deep basin in the Sound undergoes annual summer renewals in response to wind-driven upwelling on the shelf, separated by stagnation and hypoxia during fall, winter, and spring downwelling periods. Other than for the stagnant deep waters in winter, residence times in different parts of the Sound are only a few weeks. Barkley Sound characteristics thus adjust rapidly to shelf conditions, and inshore measurements can be used with care as a proxy for some shelf properties. However, phytoplankton biomass does not appear to be affected by the onset of deep renewal and the associated reversal of along-shore winds and instead responds to local factors. Finally, once the seasonal cycle has been accounted for, interannual variations in temperature, density, and dissolved oxygen are uncoupled, possibly in response to longer-term changes in the characteristics of source waters offshore and/or to changes in shelf processes.},

abstract = {Problems of environmentalism-environmental protection, conservation, and preservation-are now widely appreciated as important to human enterprise and destiny. Called to attention by advances in descriptive empirical ecology, the new problems are too complex for this same ecology to solve without further expansion of basic knowledge. Environmentalism needs an ecological science of complex systems, but its development is hindered by over-commitment of attention and resources to the applied problems. Certain aspects of environmentalism may run against the grain of how nature works; it is important to get the science right.A selection of ecological and environmental topics is reviewed from a systems ecology perspective. The ecological topics include system dynamics (linearity vs. nonlinearity, steady vs. non-steady state behavior) and indirect effects. The environmental topics are global change, overpopulation, biodiversity, and sustainability.A comprehensive hypothesis is formulated to emphasize that two kinds of science are needed, one empirical focusing on what is immediate and tangible, and the other theoretical dealing with what is indirect and intangible. Empirically based environmentalism is attentive to only the first. The hypothesis has the following elements: (1) Living processes degrade their immediate and nearby environments. (2) A maximum power principle holds that this degradation should be as quick and complete as possible. (3) By direct harnessing of maximum power, biota perform work to maximize their fitness (Type I, biological), at the cost of degraded environments. The life-environment relationship therefore becomes win-lose. (4) Maximum power also contributes to a network property, dominant indirect effects, giving rise to (5) network synergism that converts proximate interactions, mainly (+, -), and negative ones (-,-) to predominantly positive (+, +) relations, which become quantitatively dominant. (6) In following the indirect line from maximum power to network synergism, biota do work that maximizes both their own and their environment's fitness (Type II, biological and ecological). By this, the life-environment relationship becomes win-win. (7) This hypothesis has a built-in paradox: the invisible positive benefits deriving from the network synergism. →. Fitness-II line are (i) proportional to, and (ii) greater in magnitude than, the negative costs generated by the tangible, immediate, maximum power. →. Fitness-I line. (8) Therefore, environmental programs designed to power down to reduce environmental degradation will reduce not only Fitness-I, but also Fitness-II by foregoing the network synergism benefits that exceed the maximum power costs. (9) Misguided environmentalism could then produce the worst case of a lose-lose life-environment relationship. (10) Environmentalism must resolve and manage this apparent conflict, and ecology as its foundational science must expand to provide the knowledge to do so. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

Our goal is for both theoretical and empirical ecologists to be able to use the theory to interpret their findings, and to get a precise sense of the limits of its applicability. To this end, we introduce an explicit handling of limiting factors, and a new way of defining the scaling factors which partition invasion growth rates into the different mechanisms contributing to coexistence. We explain terminology such as relative nonlinearity, storage effect, and growth-density covariance, both in a formal setting and through their biological interpretation. We review the theory's applications and contributions to our current understanding of species coexistence. While the theory is very general, it is not well suited to all problems, so we carefully point out its limitations. Finally, we critique the paradigm of decomposing invasion growth rates into stabilizing and equalizing components: we argue that these concepts are useful when used judiciously, but have often been employed in an overly simplified way to justify false claims.},

abstract = {* As systems of marine protected areas (MPAs) expand globally, there is a risk that new MPAs will be biased toward places that are remote or unpromising for extractive activities, and hence follow the trend of terrestrial protected areas in being ‘residual' to commercial uses. Such locations typically provide little protection to the species and ecosystems that are most exposed to threatening processes. * There are strong political motivations to establish residual reserves that minimize costs and conflicts with users of natural resources. These motivations will likely remain in place as long as success continues to be measured in terms of area (km2) protected. * The global pattern of MPAs was reviewed and appears to be residual, supported by a rapid growth of large, remote MPAs. The extent to which MPAs in Australia are residual nationally and also regionally within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Marine Park was also examined. * Nationally, the recently announced Australian Commonwealth marine reserves were found to be strongly residual, making almost no difference to ‘business as usual' for most ocean uses. Underlying this result was the imperative to minimize costs, but without the spatial constraints of explicit quantitative objectives for representing bioregions or the range of ecological features in highly protected zones. * In contrast, the 2004 rezoning of the GBR was exemplary, and the potential for residual protection was limited by applying a systematic set of planning principles, such as representing a minimum percentage of finely subdivided bioregions. Nonetheless, even at this scale, protection was uneven between bioregions. Within-bioregion heterogeneity might have led to no-take zones being established in areas unsuitable for trawling with a risk that species assemblages differ between areas protected and areas left available for trawling. * A simple four-step framework of questions for planners and policy makers is proposed to help reverse the emerging residual tendency of MPAs and maximize their effectiveness for conservation. This involves checks on the least-cost approach to establishing MPAs in order to avoid perverse outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {Evaluating and understanding biodiversity in marine ecosystems are both necessary and challenging for conservation. This paper compiles and summarizes current knowledge of the diversity of marine taxa in Canada's three oceans while recognizing that this compilation is incomplete and will change in the future. That Canada has the longest coastline in the world and incorporates distinctly different biogeographic provinces and ecoregions (e.g., temperate through ice-covered areas) constrains this analysis. The taxonomic groups presented here include microbes, phytoplankton, macroalgae, zooplankton, benthic infauna, fishes, and marine mammals. The minimum number of species or taxa compiled here is 15,988 for the three Canadian oceans. However, this number clearly underestimates in several ways the total number of taxa present. First, there are significant gaps in the published literature. Second, the diversity of many habitats has not been compiled for all taxonomic groups (e.g., intertidal rocky shores, deep sea), and data compilations are based on short-term, directed research programs or longer-term monitoring activities with limited spatial resolution. Third, the biodiversity of large organisms is well known, but this is not true of smaller organisms. Finally, the greatest constraint on this summary is the willingness and capacity of those who collected the data to make it available to those interested in biodiversity meta-analyses. Confirmation of identities and intercomparison of studies are also constrained by the disturbing rate of decline in the number of taxonomists and systematists specializing on marine taxa in Canada. This decline is mostly the result of retirements of current specialists and to a lack of training and employment opportunities for new ones. Considering the difficulties encountered in compiling an overview of biogeographic data and the diversity of species or taxa in Canada's three oceans, this synthesis is intended to serve as a biodiversity baseline for a new program on marine biodiversity, the Canadian Healthy Ocean Network. A major effort needs to be undertaken to establish a complete baseline of Canadian marine biodiversity of all taxonomic groups, especially if we are to understand and conserve this part of Canada's natural heritage.},

With seagrasses declining in many regions, the linkages between seagrass meadows and other habitats are being altered and diminished. Thus, it is timely to summarize what is known about the prevalence and magnitude of cross-habitat exchanges of seagrass-derived energy and materials, and to increase awareness of the importance of seagrasses to adjacent and even distant habitats. To do so we examined the literature on the extent and importance of exchanges of biomass between seagrass meadows and other habitats, both in the form of exported seagrass biomass as well as transfers of animal biomass via migration. Data were most abundant for Caribbean coral reefs and Australian beaches, and organisms for which there were quantitative estimates included Caribbean fishes and North American migratory waterfowl. Overall, data from the studies we reviewed clearly showed that seagrass ecosystems provide a large subsidy to both near and distant locations through the export of particulate organic matter and living plant and animal biomass. The consequences of continuing seagrass decline thus extend far beyond the areas where seagrasses grow.},

abstract = {Blue carbon denotes the long-term storage of carbon within plant habitats growing in coastal lands and near-shore marine environments. North American blue carbon habitats—seagrass, salt marsh, and mangrove—were assessed to determine their spatial distribution and to document these sinks of blue carbon. Maps of habitat distributions on the coasts of Canada, Mexico and the United States were collected, verified and compiled to create the first continent-wide areal assessment of blue carbon. The maps show that seagrasses grow coastally throughout North America while mangroves are primarily tropical and salt marshes primarily temperate/arctic. A geodatabase was established, metadata were documented, and data and methodological gaps were assessed along with challenges in identifying the extent of these habitats. The maps compiled for North America document 24,200 square kilometers (km2) of seagrass, 13,500 km2 of salt marsh and 10,100 km2 of mangrove. Only half of the continent's seagrasses have been mapped; priority sites were identified for future mapping. Salt marsh mapping is incomplete for parts of Canada and Mexico. The area of blue carbon habitat within marine protected areas and terrestrial protected areas was determined.},

abstract = {Nutrient pollution and reduced grazing each can stimulate algal blooms as shown by numerous experiments. But because experiments rarely incorporate natural variation in environmental factors and biodiversity, conditions determining the relative strength of bottom-up and top-down forcing remain unresolved. We factorially added nutrients and reduced grazing at 15 sites across the range of the marine foundation species eelgrass (Zostera marina) to quantify how top-down and bottom-up control interact with natural gradients in biodiversity and environmental forcing. Experiments confirmed modest top-down control of algae, whereas fertilisation had no general effect. Unexpectedly, grazer and algal biomass were better predicted by cross-site variation in grazer and eelgrass diversity than by global environmental gradients. Moreover, these large-scale patterns corresponded strikingly with prior small-scale experiments. Our results link global and local evidence that biodiversity and top-down control strongly influence functioning of threatened seagrass ecosystems, and suggest that biodiversity is comparably important to global change stressors.},

abstract = {Investigations of the dispersal of the eggs and larvae of the plaice in the Southern Bight of the North Sea have involved measurement of the egg and larval distributions, the dye tracer Rhoda- mine-B and an array of moored current meters. The spread of the egg and larval distributions changed little as the eggs and larvae developed, suggesting that turbulent diffusion was at a com- paratively slow rate. This conclusion was supported by the results of the tracer experiment and the application of a mathematical model of diffusion. In this area the vertical shear diffusion process is much more important than horizontal turbulence in producing dispersal. The current meter results showed that in the central Southern Bight there was little difference between water move- ments at different geographical positions. Provided that attention was confined to water move- ments along the main tidal axis, the current meter results and the movement of the Rhodamine patch showed a constant proportionality to water movements through the Dover Strait. A marked difference between the northeasterly drift of larvae in 1962 and 1969 was found to correspond to similar differences in the flow through the Dover Strait.},

abstract = {Recent syntheses on the evolutionary causes of dispersal have focused on dispersal as a direct adaptation, but many traits that influence dispersal have other functions, raising the question: when is dispersal 'for' dispersal? We review and critically evaluate the ecological causes of selection on traits that give rise to dispersal in marine and terrestrial organisms. In the sea, passive dispersal is relatively easy and specific morphological, behavioural, and physiological adaptations for dispersal are rare. Instead, there may often be selection to limit dispersal. On land, dispersal is relatively difficult without specific adaptations, which are relatively common. Although selection for dispersal is expected in both systems and traits leading to dispersal are often linked to fitness, systems may differ in the extent to which dispersal in nature arises from direct selection for dispersal or as a by-product of selection on traits with other functions. Our analysis highlights incompleteness of theories that assume a simple and direct relationship between dispersal and fitness, not just insofar as they ignore a vast array of taxa in the marine realm, but also because they may be missing critically important effects of traits influencing dispersal in all realms.},

abstract = {Norway lobster Nephrops norvegjcus (L.) larvae are hatched into the water column from areas of fine mud and spend about 50 d in the plankton before resettling onto mud as juveniles. Whilst in the pelagic environment, however, advection and horizontal turbulent diffusion spread larvae away from the mud region and thus potentially could limit recruitment. A simple advection-diffusion-mortality model has been used to examine the likely losses of larvae from an N. norvegicus system due to pelagic dispersal. Turbulent diffusion alone causes insufficient loss to affect recruitment on mud patches larger than 20 X 20 km for reasonable estimates of eddy diffusivity. Low levels of mean advection (0.04 to 0.05 m S-'), however, severely limit settlement even on very large mud areas (100 X 100 km). Distributions of larvae released from a mud region In the western Irish Sea consistently show them to be spread southward away from the mud patch although it remains unclear whether advection in the region is sufficiently large for these losses to influence recruitment.},

abstract = {Coral reef fishes typically undergo a pelagic larval phase prior to recruitment to reef habitat. This is potentially risky, but likely to be important in connecting populations and avoiding local crowding. Predation pressures on larvae on and off the reef are likely to differ both in origin and intensity. In this study, we used individual-based models to explore in isolation the effect of elevated levels of larval mortality on the reef in 22 different landscapes. We allowed the movement of highly simplified larvae to evolve through selection and mutation events and tracked emerging strategies over 180 generations. The pressure of increased larval mortality on the reef affected overall population sizes and selected for higher levels of larval movement. However, the evolution of movement was constrained, and self-recruitment back to the reef of origin was prevalent, with levels rarely dropping below 50{\%}. The evolved strategies were highly landscape specific, suggesting that movement in contiguous reefs is more readily evolved than at isolated reefs. Future development of this simulation approach will provide a valuable research tool for exploring important evolutionary, ecological, and management-based questions. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

Single particle studies are the most common. The prevalent analysis involves binning velocities geographically to estimate the Eulerian means and lateral diffusivities. However single particle statistics have also been used to study Rossby wave propagation, the influence of bottom topography and eddy heat fluxes. Other studies have used stochastic models to simulate dispersion, calculated Lagrangian frequency spectra and examined the relation between Lagrangian and Eulerian integral scales. Studies involving pairs of particles are fewer, and the results are not well-established yet. There are indications that pair separations grow exponentially in time below the deformation radius, as is also the case in the stratosphere. The behavior at larger scales is less clear, indicating either a turbulent cascade or dispersion by the sheared large-scale circulation. In addition, three or more particles can be used to measure relative vorticity and divergence. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Humans interact with the oceans in diverse and profound ways. The scope, magnitude, footprint and ultimate cumulative impacts of human activities can threaten ocean ecosystems and have changed over time, resulting in new challenges and threats to marine ecosystems. A fundamental gap in understanding how humanity is affecting the oceans is our limited knowledge about the pace of change in cumulative impact on ocean ecosystems from expanding human activities – and the patterns, locations and drivers of most significant change. To help address this, we combined high resolution, annual data on the intensity of 14 human stressors and their impact on 21 marine ecosystems over 11 years (2003–2013) to assess pace of change in cumulative impacts on global oceans, where and how much that pace differs across the ocean, and which stressors and their impacts contribute most to those changes. We found that most of the ocean (59{\%}) is experiencing significantly increasing cumulative impact, in particular due to climate change but also from fishing, land-based pollution and shipping. Nearly all countries saw increases in cumulative impacts in their coastal waters, as did all ecosystems, with coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves at most risk. Mitigation of stressors most contributing to increases in overall cumulative impacts is urgently needed to sustain healthy oceans.},

abstract = {Data collected during 7 years of seasonal surveys are used to investigate the distribution of phytoplankton biomass within the estuarine waters of the Strait of Georgia and Juan de Fuca Strait. Variability of the chlorophyll distribution is examined in relation to the density stratification, light availability and nutrient concentration. In the Strait of Georgia, both the horizontal and vertical distribution of chlorophyll are found to be linked to the presence of a near-surface layer of increased density stratification. Despite important year-to-year variability, the seasonal cycle of chlorophyll in the Strait of Georgia is dominated every year by relatively large near-surface concentrations in the spring that are linked to the seasonal increase in solar radiation onto the stratified near-surface layer. In the vertical, a sub-surface peak is observed around 10 m depth, corresponding to the depth of maximum water column stability. Nutrients within the euphotic zone are in general abundant, with the exception of the Strait of Georgia in summer where phytoplankton growth is potentially limited by low nitrate concentration near the surface. The depth of the euphotic zone is estimated along the thalweg of the estuary from transmissometer profiles. It appears to vary relatively little within the estuary from a minimum of 20 m in spring, near the mouth of the Fraser River, to an autumnal maximum of about 30 m in the northern Strait of Georgia. Finally, the estimated self-shading contribution to light attenuation is shown to be generally significant (5-10{\%}) in the surface waters of the Strait of Georgia, during spring and summer, reaching values as high as 35{\%} during the spring bloom.

To date, the locations and extents of reefs have only been assessed by multibeam echosounders, a method that does not resolve where live, dead and buried sponges are within a reef. We performed fine-scale (25 and 12.5 m grids) photographic surveys using remote operated vehicles and carried out GIS and semivariogram analysis to produce high resolution maps of the spatial distribution and abundance of glass sponges among 3 reefs in the Strait of Georgia and also to determine the community structure of animals associated with the reefs. Within a reef, glass sponges are clustered in spatially dependent patches 35 to 72 m in diameter, which we interpret to result from growth and reproduction processes. Reefs occur within a narrow range of depths (30 to 50 m), which may be explained by suspension feeding requirements for flow, which is accelerated over the underlying elevated bedrock mounds and ridges. The local abundance of fish and crustaceans was significantly higher in the presence of glass sponges while significantly lower abundances of molluscs and other sponges were found within the reefs. Also, we determined that a dense population of reef sponges can process water at 83 000 l s(-1), removing carbon at a rate of 0.96 g C m(-2) d(-1). Our high resolution mapping establishes a biological baseline for 3 glass sponge reefs in the Strait of Georgia.},

Our findings demonstrate that implementation of auto-correlated directional swimming can result in an increase of up to ×2.7 in the estimated success rate of larval-settlement, as well as an increase in the extent of connectivity.

Although there is concern over the negative effects imposed by introduced species, positive effects are also possible. Introduced species may facilitate local resident species by providing or modifying habitat; these positive effects are sometimes overlooked, but are important for decisions about the local management of non-native species. The introduction of Zostera japonica to the Northeast Pacific coast is a case of a non-native foundation species that appears to expand total eelgrass habitat area, potentially facilitating local eelgrass-inhabiting species. In this study, we asked whether the non-native Z. japonica provides habitat for eelgrass-dwelling invertebrates that is similar to its native congener, Z. marina. We systematically quantified invertebrate assemblages in the two eelgrass species and quantified eelgrass characteristics that are relevant to epifaunal habitat quality (e.g. shoot density and surface area). We found that Z. japonica supports a greater total abundance of the same invertebrate species found in Z. marina meadows; however, the relative abundance of invertebrate species differed between Z. japonica and Z. marina. This result is consistent with differences in the two congeners' morphological characteristics, density of vegetative and reproductive shoots, and total blade surface area per square metre. We conclude that the expansion of total eelgrass habitat due to the introduction of Z. japonica appears to increase the available habitat for local epifaunal invertebrate communities.},

Hence, it is important to know which types of MPAs are more effective, and under which conditions. No-take marine reserves – the MPAs with stronger protection – are very effective in restoring and preserving biodiversity, and in enhancing ecosystem resilience. A new meta-analysis of previous studies shows that biomass of whole fish assemblages in marine reserves is, on average, 670{\%} greater than in adjacent unprotected areas, and 343{\%} greater than in partially-protected MPAs. Marine reserves also help restore the complexity of ecosystems through a chain of ecological effects (trophic cascades) once the abundance of large animals recovers sufficiently. Marine reserves may not be immune to the effects of climate change, but to date, reserves with complex ecosystems are more resilient than unprotected areas. Although marine reserves were conceived to protect ecosystems within their boundaries, they have also been shown to enhance local fisheries and create jobs and new incomes through ecotourism.},

abstract = {Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66{\%}; RS: 76{\%}). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7–6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.},

abstract = {Ecologists and conservation biologists are keenly interested in how patterns of species diversity change across spatial scales. We examined how additive partitioning can be used to statistically evaluate spatial patterns of species diversity and develop conservation strategies. We applied additive partitioning to data on arboreal beetle diversity (richness, Shannon, Simpson) collected from a nested design consisting of four hierarchical levels-trees, forest stands, sites, and ecoregions-that corresponded to increasingly broader spatial scales within the eastern deciduous forest of Ohio and Indiana (U.S.A.). A significant percentage (relative to that of randomization tests) of total species richness and Shannon and Simpson diversity was attributed to beta diversity between ecoregions and, to a lesser extent, among sites (parks and nature preserves) within ecoregions. Hierarchical cluster analysis corroborated these findings. We also found differences between rare species ({\textless}0.05{\%} of total abundance) and common species ({\textgreater}0.5{\%} of total abundance) in the overall percentage of richness explained by each spatial scale. Rare species accounted for the majority (45{\%}) of the 583 total beetle species in our study and were strongly influenced by broad spatial scales (i.e., ecoregions), whereas the richness of common species was significantly greater than expected across the range of spatial scales (from trees to ecoregions). Our results suggest that the most effective way to preserve beetle diversity in the eastern deciduous forest of the United States is to acquire and protect multiple sites within different ecoregions. More generally, we advocate the use of diversity partitioning because it complements existing models in conservation biology and provides a unique approach to understanding species diversity across spatial scales.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrasses have been well studied at the leaf to patch scales, however, the link to large spatial extent landscape and population dynamics is still unresolved in seagrass ecology. Traditional remote sensing approaches have lacked the temporal resolution and consistency to appropriately address this issue. This study uses two high temporal resolution time-series of thematic seagrass cover maps to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrass at both an inter- and intra-annual time scales, one of the first globally to do so at this scale. Previous work by the authors developed an object-based approach to map seagrass cover level distribution from a long term archive of Landsat TM and ETM+ images on the Eastern Banks (≈200 km2), Moreton Bay, Australia. In this work a range of trend and time-series analysis methods are demonstrated for a time-series of 23 annual maps from 1988 to 2010 and a time-series of 16 monthly maps during 2008-2010. Significant new insight was presented regarding the inter- and intra-annual dynamics of seagrass persistence over time, seagrass cover level variability, seagrass cover level trajectory, and change in area of seagrass and cover levels over time. Overall we found that there was no significant decline in total seagrass area on the Eastern Banks, but there was a significant decline in seagrass cover level condition. A case study of two smaller communities within the Eastern Banks that experienced a decline in both overall seagrass area and condition are examined in detail, highlighting possible differences in environmental and process drivers. We demonstrate how trend and time-series analysis enabled seagrass distribution to be appropriately assessed in context of its spatial and temporal history and provides the ability to not only quantify change, but also describe the type of change. We also demonstrate the potential use of time-series analysis products to investigate seagrass growth and decline as well as the processes that drive it. This study demonstrates clear benefits over traditional seagrass mapping and monitoring approaches, and provides a proof of concept for the use of trend and time-series analysis of remotely sensed seagrass products to benefit current endeavours in seagrass ecology. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) that exclude fishing have been shown repeatedly to enhance the abundance, size, and diversity of species. These benefits, however, mean little to most marine species, because individual protected areas typically are small. To meet the larger-scale conservation challenges facing ocean ecosystems, several nations are expanding the benefits of individual protected areas by building networks of protected areas. Doing so successfully requires a detailed understanding of the ecological and physical characteristics of ocean ecosystems and the responses of humans to spatial closures. There has been enormous scientific interest in these topics, and frameworks for the design of MPA networks for meeting conservation and fishery management goals are emerging. Persistent in the literature is the perception of an inherent tradeoff between achieving conservation and fishery goals. Through a synthetic analysis across these conservation and bioeconomic studies, we construct guidelines for MPA network design that reduce or eliminate this tradeoff. We present size, spacing, location, and configuration guidelines for designing networks that simultaneously can enhance biological conservation and reduce fishery costs or even increase fishery yields and profits. Indeed, in some settings, a well-designed MPA network is critical to the optimal harvest strategy. When reserves benefit fisheries, the optimal area in reserves is moderately large (mode ≈30{\%}). Assessing network design principals is limited currently by the absence of empirical data from large-scale networks. Emerging networks will soon rectify this constraint.},

abstract = {The complexity of climate change impacts on ecological processes necessitates flexible and adaptive conservation strategies that cross traditional disciplines. Current strategies involving protected areas are predominantly fixed in space, and may on their own be inadequate under climate change. Here, we propose a novel approach to climate adaptation that combines permanent protected areas with temporary conservation areas to create flexible networks. Previous work has tended to consider permanent and dynamic protection as separate actions, but their integration could draw on the strengths of both approaches to improve biodiversity conservation and help manage for ecological uncertainty in the coming decades. As there are often time lags between the establishment of permanent protected areas, the inclusion of dynamic conservation areas within permanent networks could provide critical transient protection to mitigate land-use changes and biodiversity redistributions. This integrated approach may be particularly useful in highly human-modified and fragmented landscapes where areas of conservation value are limited and long-term place-based protection is unfeasible. To determine when such an approach may be feasible, we propose the use of a decision framework. Under certain scenarios, these coupled networks have the potential to increase spatio-temporal network connectivity and help maintain biodiversity and ecological processes under climate change. Implementing these networks would require multidisciplinary scientific evidence, new policies, creative funding solutions, and broader acceptance of a dynamic approach to biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {To ensure the long-term persistence of biodiversity, conservation strategies must account for the entire range of climate change impacts. A variety of spatial prioritisation techniques have been developed to incorporate climate change. Here, we provide the first standardised review of these approaches. Using a systematic search, we analysed peer-reviewed spatial prioritisation publications (n = 46) and found that the most common approaches (n = 41, 89{\%}) utilised forecasts of species distributions and aimed to either protect future species habitats (n = 24, 52{\%}) or identify climate refugia to shelter species from climate change (n = 17, 37{\%}). Other approaches (n = 17, 37{\%}) used well-established conservation planning principles to combat climate change, aimed at broadly increasing either connectivity (n = 11, 24{\%}) or the degree of heterogeneity of abiotic factors captured in the planning process (n = 8, 17{\%}), with some approaches combining multiple goals. We also find a strong terrestrial focus (n = 35, 76{\%}), and heavy geographical bias towards North America (n = 8, 17{\%}) and Australia (n = 11, 24{\%}). While there is an increasing trend of incorporating climate change into spatial prioritisation, we found that serious gaps in current methodologies still exist. Future research must focus on developing methodologies that allow planners to incorporate human responses to climate change and recognise that discrete climate impacts (e.g. extreme events), which are increasing in frequency and severity, must be addressed within the spatial prioritisation framework. By identifying obvious gaps and highlighting future research needs this review will help practitioners better plan for conservation action in the face of multiple threats including climate change.},

abstract = {Unsustainable hunting is emptying forests of large animals around the world, but current understanding of how human foraging spreads across landscapes has been stymied by data deficiencies and cryptic hunter behaviour. Unlike other global threats to biodiversity like deforestation, climate change and overfishing, maps of wild meat hunters' movements-often based on forest accessibility-typically cover small scales and are rarely validated with real-world observations. Using camera trapping data from rainforests across Malaysian Borneo, we show that while hunter movements are strongly correlated with the accessibility of different parts of the landscape, accessibility measures are most informative when they integrate fine-scale habitat features like topography and land cover. Measures of accessibility naive to fine-scale habitat complexity, like distance to the nearest road or settlement, generate poor approximations of hunters' movements. In comparison, accessibility as measured by high-resolution movement models based on circuit theory provides vastly better reflections of real-world foraging movements. Our results highlight that simple models incorporating fine-scale landscape heterogeneity can be powerful tools for understanding and predicting widespread threats to biodiversity.},

For species with slow demography and limited dispersal, such as trees, lags between climate change and distribution shifts are likely to increase in the future. Such lags can be of critical importance to management and biodiversity of forests, because they can result in 'extinction debts', where populations temporarily persist under unsuitable conditions, and 'colonization credits', where suitable locations are not occupied owing to slow demography and limited dispersal. Here we use a range dynamics model based on metapopulation theory to show that the distributions of 21 dominant trees in eastern North America are out of equilibrium with climate and demonstrate both extinction debt and colonization credit. Moreover, lags are more severe at northern range limits, suggesting that range contraction in response to warming temperatures will outpace expansion.},

Populations of marine organisms on coral reef islands (CRI) are connected in space and time by seawater that transports propagules of plants, animals, and algae. Yet, despite this reality, it is often assumed that routine replenishment of populations of marine organisms on CRI is supported by locally-sourced propagules (hereafter, larvae). Following large disturbances, however, distantly-sourced larvae from less disturbed CRI within a regional meta-population are likely to be important for local population recovery, but evaluating the roles of locally- vs. distantly-sourced larvae remains difficult. While larval sources are relatively well-known for some fishes, they remain virtually unknown for most taxa, particularly those associated with the benthos, as exemplified by scleractinian corals. This review focuses on reef recovery and larval connectivity. Using corals as examples, we argue that CRI can serve as natural laboratories in which studies of these issues can enhance understanding of coral reef community dynamics under future disturbance regimes. Rather than focusing on synthesizing empirical data, we focus on the capacity for CRI to realize their potential in this research area, concluding that progress is impeded by the limited breadth, detail, and spatio-temporal concordance of existing research. Using long-term observational programs of coral reefs in Mo'orea (French Polynesia), Okinawa (Japan), and St. John (US Virgin Islands) as examples of the data currently available, we make the case that new modes of multidisciplinary and collaborative research will be required to exploit the value of CRI in understanding the role of connectivity in mediating ecosystem resilience in a future affected by anthropogenic disturbances.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Current numerical methods for simulating biophysical processes in aquatic environments are typically constructed in a grid-based Eulerian framework or as an individual-based model in a particle-based Lagrangian framework. Often, the biogeochemical processes and physical (hydrodynamic) processes occur at different time and space scales, and changes in biological processes do not affect the hydrodynamic conditions. Therefore, it is possible to develop an alternative strategy to grid-based approaches for linking hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models that can significantly improve computational efficiency for this type of linked biophysical model. In this work, we utilize a new technique that links hydrodynamic effects and biological processes through a property-carrying particle model (PCPM) in a Lagrangian/Eulerian framework. The model is tested in idealized cases and its utility is demonstrated in a practical application to Sandusky Bay. Results show the integration of Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches allows for a natural coupling of mass transport (represented by particle movements and random walk) and biological processes in water columns which is described by a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) biological model. This method is far more efficient than traditional tracer-based Eulerian biophysical models for 3-D simulation, particularly for a large domain and/or ensemble simulations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Additionally, to compare model predictions with previously described barriers and build a more thorough understanding of the region's biogeographic patterns. Location The reefs of the Indo-West Pacific Ocean, from 100 to 170°E and from 30°N to 30°S. Methods A biophysical larval dispersal model was used to quantify over 800,000 dispersal kernels by simulating 99 model taxa. Spatial analysis was used to map emergent patterns of potential multispecies population connectivity and predict geographic locations and strength of concordant dispersal barriers across the seascape. Results Although individual taxa varied in their predicted fine-scale population connectivity, there was consistency in the location of dispersal barriers. Across all trait combinations, reproductive output (fecundity and density of reproductive adults), reproductive strategy (spawning phenology) and the length of the larval dispersal phase determined the strength of barriers across the seascape. More than 80{\%} of the previously described marine boundaries in the region were predicted to restrict the dispersal of at least 10{\%} of the simulated taxa. The location and strength of many additional multitaxa barriers were described at scales {\textless}200 km. Main conclusions The geographic structure of many previously described multispecies barriers across the Indo-West Pacific were predicted with the biophysical dispersal model and spatial analysis. The permeability of individual dispersal barriers was primarily determined by reproductive output, spawning phenology and the length of the pelagic larval stage. Across all dispersal barriers analysed, Euclidean distance explained up to 49{\%} of the variation in barrier strength.},

Here we present an updated analysis of potential cumulative effects in Canada's Pacific marine waters. New, updated datasets and methodological improvements over the previous analysis were completed, including a new index for land-based effects on marine habitats, updated habitat classes and a modified treatment of vulnerability scores. The results show increased potential cumulative effects for the region. Fishing remains the biggest overall impact amongst marine activities, while land-based activities have the highest impact per unit area in affected ocean areas. Intertidal areas were the most affected habitat per unit area, while pelagic habitats had the highest total cumulative effect score. Regular updates of cumulative effects assessments will make them more useful for management, but these require regularly updated, high resolution datasets across all activity types, and automated, well-documented procedures to make them accessible to managers and policy-makers.},

Delineation and continuous monitoring of eelgrass distribution is an integral part of understanding these pressures and providing effective coastal ecosystem management. A proposed tool for such spatial monitoring is remote imagery, which can cost- and time-effectively cover large and inaccessible areas frequently. However, to effectively apply this technology, an understanding is required of the spectral behavior of eelgrass and its associated substrates. In this study, in situ hyperspectral measurements were used to define key spectral variables that provide the greatest spectral separation between Z. marina and associated submerged substrates. For eelgrass classification of an in situ above water reflectance dataset, the selected variables were: slope 500530 nm, first derivatives (R) at 566 nm, 580 nm, and 602 nm, yielding 98{\%} overall accuracy. When the in situ reflectance dataset was water-corrected, the selected variables were: 566:600 and 566:710, yielding 97{\%} overall accuracy. The depth constraint for eelgrass identification with the field spectrometer was 5.0 to 6.0 m on average, with a range of 3.0 to 15.0 m depending on the characteristics of the water column. A case study involving benthic classification of hyperspectral airborne imagery showed the major advantage of the variable selection was meeting the sample size requirements of the more statistically complex Maximum Likelihood classifier.

This laboratory study quantified behavioral responses of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) larvae to estuarine chemical cues to examine the role of water chemistry as an orientation cue for locating or remaining in settlement habitat. Spontaneous activity (kinesis) was measured for pre-settlement-size larvae exposed to artificial sea water (as a negative control) and one of six treatments (sterilized sea water, sea water from a channel at ebb tide, sea water from a channel at flood tide, sea water from seagrass habitat, tannic acid dissolved in sterilized sea water, or lignin dissolved in sterilized sea water). Larvae that reached a size of competency to settle (approximately 10 mm standard length) swam faster when exposed to lignin dissolved in sterilized sea water than in other treatments; smaller larvae showed no response. Olfactory preference (taxis) was tested using a paired-choice experiment. Settlement-size larvae preferred water from seagrass beds to artificial sea water. The observed chemokinesis and chemotaxis in response to lignin dissolved in sterilized sea water and sea water from a seagrass bed demonstrate that red drum larvae can distinguish and respond to different water masses and suggest that chemical stimuli from seagrass settlement habitat may aid in orientation and movement to or retention in suitable settlement sites.},

abstract = {Understanding connectivity remains a fundamental challenge to marine ecology due to technical limitations of tracking larval dispersal. Marine population genetic analyses are often used to make inferences about the scale of population connectivity. For species with a larval phase, pelagic larval duration (PLD) is assumed to influence the scale of connectivity. If PLD and genetic metrics are reliable proxies of connectivity, the 2 should be well correlated. Previous tests report conflicting results, with many reports that global F ST (Wright's fixation index) correlates poorly with PLD, and one very high correlation of isolation-by-distance (IBD) slope, which is derived from F ST, with PLD. First we clarify the expectations for the performance of these different proxies in light of the latest understanding of larval dispersal dynamics. We then test the hypothesis that IBD slope may be a more robust correlate with dispersal scale than global F ST with a new dataset of recent marine genetic studies. Re-evaluation of previously published and new datasets revealed a consistent, moderate fit (R 2 ∼0.30) between genetic and PLD proxies of dispersal (using either IBD slope or global F ST), with significant improvement for small-scale ({\textless}650 km) studies (R 2 = 0.50), and important effects of marker type. Significant effects of number of individuals and number of populations sampled on the genetic metrics in our dataset suggest a common need for more robust sampling designs. These results synchronize previous studies on this topic and provide validation that PLD and genetic metrics typically reflect scales of dispersal, as intended, at least when sampling design is robust. {\textcopyright} 2011 Inter-Research.},

abstract = {Aim: Rapid anthropogenic warming coupled with changes in land use is altering the distributions of species, with consequences for ecosystem functioning and services. It is crucial to evaluate species range shifts based on understanding of the interaction of temperature with non-climatic factors such as habitat availability and dispersal potential. Here, we aim to investigate roles of environmental temperature, habitat availability and population connectivity on the distributions of hard-shore intertidal animals. We further examine potential roles of extensive artificial seawall construction in enabling poleward expansion of species in China, thus reshaping coastal biogeography. Location: Chinese coast. Time period: 2013–2017. Major taxa studied: Intertidal invertebrates. Methods: We took an integrative approach encompassing distributional ecology, thermal physiology, molecular genetics, heat budget modelling and larval dispersal to elucidate how interacting multiple drivers, including temperature, habitat availability and larval dispersal, determine distributions of hard-shore invertebrates, focusing on what sets their range edges at a boundary between biogeographic provinces. Results: Our results untangle the complex interactions of global climate change with the impacts of regional scale coastal development. Temperature, larval transport and habitat availability are the major proximate factors controlling the range limits of coastal marine species. The artificial shorelines provide suitable habitats for hard-shore species on the Yangtze River Delta, and minimum temperature in winter is an important factor setting the new northern range limit of these hard-shore species along the Chinese coast. Main conclusions: In the face of global warming and global sprawl of marine hard infrastructure, species distributions, community structures and biogeographic patterns are experiencing dramatic changes. The combined influence of multiple human stressors including climate change and artificial shorelines can be evaluated by using a multidisciplinary framework, including ecological distribution, physiological sensitivity of species to these stressors, and the role of dispersal in maintaining population connectivity.},

abstract = {Maintaining habitat diversity and heterogeneity are key ecological elements of marine spatial planning. It is often assumed that patches of the same habitat harbour similar biological diversity. However, if habitat heterogeneity is high then the efficacy of habitats as surrogates of species diversity is weakened. Beta diversity variation in fish assemblages in eelgrass meadows along the Pacific coast of Canada was analysed using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and tests for dispersion of homogeneity. Variations in species composition were examined at an inter-regional scale (100s of km apart) and an intra-regional scale (10s of km apart) over 7years. Further, similarity percentage analysis and biological-environmental modelling were used to identify factors that differentiated among fish assemblages. Beta diversity turnover was also considered by examining for the decay in fish assemblage similarity across gradients in sea surface temperature, salinity, and physical distance between pairs-of-meadows using linear regression. Patches of eelgrass meadows exhibited high fish assemblage dissimilarity at both the intra-regional and inter-regional scales; spatial factors accounted for substantially more variation in fish composition than temporal factors. A large number of fish species (20-30) and different suites of environmental factors accounted for the observed high beta diversity variation. Fish composition similarity did not decay consistently within each region with physical distance between meadows or with a change of 1°C in temperature, but Jaccard similarity did decay significantly within each region by 2-4{\%} per part per thousand change in salinity. It is recommended that marine protected area planners consider the influence of freshwater flow into the coastal ocean and its subsequent impact on environmental gradients, which drives fish assemblage heterogeneity among eelgrass habitat patches. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Marine reserve networks must ensure the representation of important conservation features, and also guarantee the persistence of key populations. For many species, designing reserve networks is complicated by the absence or limited availability of spatial and life-history data. This is particularly true for data on larval dispersal, which has only recently become available. However, systematic conservation planning methods currently incorporate demographic processes through unsatisfactory surrogates. There are therefore two key challenges to designing marine reserve networks that achieve feature representation and demographic persistence constraints. First, constructing a method that efficiently incorporates persistence as well as complementary feature representation. Second, incorporating persistence using a mechanistic description of population viability, rather than a proxy such as size or distance. Here we construct a novel systematic conservation planning method that addresses both challenges, and parameterise it to design a hypothetical marine reserve network for fringing coral reefs in the Keppel Islands, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. For this application, we describe how demographic persistence goals can be constructed for an important reef fish species in the region, the bar-cheeked trout ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Plectropomus maculatus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}). We compare reserve networks that are optimally designed for either feature representation or demographic persistence, with a reserve network that achieves both goals simultaneously. As well as being practically applicable, our analyses also provide general insights into marine reserve planning for both representation and demographic persistence. First, persistence constraints for dispersive organisms are likely to be much harder to achieve than representation targets, due to their greater complexity. Second, persistence and representation constraints pull the reserve network design process in divergent directions, making it difficult to efficiently achieve both constraints. Although our method can be readily applied to the data-rich Keppel Islands case study, we finally consider the factors that limit the method?s utility in information-poor contexts common in marine conservation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A field experiment showed that the breaking strength of post-flowering rhipidia decreased significantly over a 30-day period, indicating that ontogenetic changes of the morphology facilitate dislodgement of the rhipidia at the optimal time for dispersal. We recorded positive buoyancy of detached post-flowering rhipidia for at least 26 days. Finally, we found evidence for sexual reproduction via seeds in the study area. These results, together with field measurements of wind-driven surface-transport velocity of rhipidia and wind data from 7 years, allowed us to model a dispersal potential of up to 150 km in one season along the Swedish west coast, which corresponds well with published estimates of dispersal potential from both observational and genetic studies. The results add to evidence that rafting of seeds on floating reproductive shoots is an important dispersal strategy for eelgrass, allowing for colonisation of new areas and for recolonisation after die-back events. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Concepts and theory for the design and application of terrestrial reserves is based on our understanding of environmental, ecological, and evolutionary processes responsible for biological diversity and sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems and how humans have influenced these processes. How well this terrestrial-based theory can be applied toward the design and application of reserves in the coastal marine environment depends, in part, on the degree of similarity between these systems. Several marked differences in ecological and evolutionary processes exist between marine and terrestrial ecosystems as ramifications of fundamental differences in their physical environments (i.e., the relative prevalence of air and water) and contemporary patterns of human impacts. Most notably, the great extent and rate of dispersal of nutrients, materials, holoplanktonic organisms, and reproductive propagules of benthic organisms expand scales of connectivity among near-shore communities and ecosystems. Consequently, the "openness" of marine populations, communities, and ecosystems probably has marked influences on their spatial, genetic, and trophic structures and dynamics in ways experienced by only some terrestrial species. Such differences appear to be particularly significant for the kinds of organisms most exploited and targeted for protection in coastal marine ecosystems (fishes and macroinvertebrates). These and other differences imply some unique design criteria and application of reserves in the marine environment. In explaining the implications of these differences for marine reserve design and application, we identify many of the environmental and ecological processes and design criteria necessary for consideration in the development of the analytical approaches developed elsewhere in this Special Issue.},

The framework is highly generic and modular, and is designed to be used for any type of drift calculations in the ocean or atmosphere. A specific module within the OpenDrift framework corresponds to a Lagrangian particle model in the traditional sense. A number of modules have already been developed, including an oil drift model, a stochastic search and rescue model, a pelagic egg model, and a basic module for atmospheric drift. The framework allows for the ingestion of an unspecified number of forcing fields (scalar and vectorial) from various sources, including Eulerian ocean, atmosphere and wave models, but also measurements or subjective estimates of the same variables. A basic backtracking mechanism is inherent, using sign reversal of the total displacement vector and negative time stepping. OpenDrift is fast and simple to set up and use on Linux, Mac and Windows environments, and can be used with minimal or no Python experience. It is designed for flexibility, and researchers may easily adapt or write modules for their specific purpose. OpenDrift is also designed for performance, and simulations with millions of particles may be performed on a laptop. Further, OpenDrift is designed for robustness, and is in daily operational use for emergency preparedness modeling (oil drift, search and rescue and drifting ships) at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In systems where dispersal is undertaken by small propagules, such as larvae in the ocean, documenting LDD is especially challenging. Genetic parentage analysis has gained traction as a method for measuring larval dispersal, but such studies are generally spatially limited, leaving LDD understudied in marine species. We addressed this knowledge gap by uncovering LDD with population assignment tests in the coral reef fish Elacatinus lori, a species whose short-distance dispersal has been well-characterized by parentage analysis. When adults (n = 931) collected throughout the species' range were categorized into three source populations, assignment accuracy exceeded 99{\%}, demonstrating low rates of gene flow between populations in the adult generation. After establishing high assignment confidence, we assigned settlers (n = 3,828) to source populations. Within the settler cohort, {\textless}0.1{\%} of individuals were identified as long-distance dispersers from other populations. These results demonstrate an exceptionally low level of connectivity between E. lori populations, despite the potential for ocean currents to facilitate LDD. More broadly, these findings illustrate the value of combining genetic parentage analysis and population assignment tests to uncover short- and long-distance dispersal, respectively.},

abstract = {In natural images, the distance measure between two images taken at different locations rises smoothly with increasing distance between the locations. This fact can be exploited for local visual homing where the task is to reach a goal location that is characterized by a snapshot image: descending in the image distance will lead the agent to the goal location. To compute an estimate of the spatial gradient in the distance measure, its value must be sampled at three noncollinear points. An animal or robot would have to insert exploratory movements into its home trajectory to collect these samples. Here we suggest a method based on the matched-filter concept that allows one to estimate the gradient without exploratory movements. Two matched filters--optical flow fields resulting from translatory movements in the horizontal plane--are used to predict two images in perpendicular directions from the current location. We investigate the relation to differential flow methods applied to the local homing problem and show that the matched-filter approach produces reliable homing behavior on image databases. Two alternative methods that only require a single matched filter are suggested. The matched-filter concept is also applied to derive a home-vector equation for a Fourier-based parameter method.},

abstract = {In contrast to marine organisms whose offspring go through an extended planktonic stage, the young of others develop directly into benthic juveniles or into yolky nonfeeding larvae that spend only a few hours in the plankton before settling. Yet, paradoxically, many such species have geographic distributions that are comparable to those with a pelagic dispersal stage. This article reviews some of the ways in which these organisms can expand their distributions: drifting, rafting, hitchhiking, creeping, and hopping. Drifting applies to species in which larvae may be short-lived, but adults can detach or be detached from their benthic substratum and be passively carried to new areas, floating at the water's surface or below it. Many encrusting species and mobile species can spread by rafting, settling on natural or artificial floating substrata which are propelled by wind and currents to new regions. Hitchhiking applies to those attaching to vessels or being carried in ballast water of ships to a distant region in which their offspring can survive. Other marine species extend their distributions by hopping from one island of hard substratum or favorable sedimentary microhabitat to another, while creeping species extend their distributions along shores or shelves where habitats remain similar for long distances.},

We found that MPAs can greatly enhance the population benefits of restoration but at a small cost to fishery yields. Generally, restoring inside MPAs had a better overall gains-loss outcome, especially if the system is under high fishing pressure or severe habitat loss. However, restoring outside became preferable when predatory fish indirectly benefit kelp habitats. In either case, successful restoration actions may be difficult to detect in time-series data due to complex transient dynamics.

In these applications, graph nodes represent habitat patches or local populations and links indicate functional connections among populations (i.e. via dispersal). Graphs are models of more complicated real systems, and so it is appropriate to review these applications from the perspective of modelling in general.

We assessed the relationships between sea temperature and observed distributional ranges for 1,790 shallow-water marine species from 10 animal classes and found remarkable consistencies in trends in realized thermal limits among taxa and ocean basins, as well as general agreement with previous laboratory findings. Realized thermal niches increase from the Equator towards cold–temperate locations, despite an opposite trend in geographic range size. Species' cool distribution limits are best predicted by the magnitude of seasonality within their range, while a relatively firm thermal barrier exists on the equatorward range edge for temperate species. Our findings of consistencies in realized thermal limits indicate potential limits to adaptation among common marine species and highlight the value of realized thermal niches for predicting species' distributional dynamics in warming seas.},

abstract = {We integrated coral reef connectivity data for the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico into a conservation decision-making framework for designing a regional scale marine protected area (MPA) network that provides insight into ecological and political contexts. We used an ocean circulation model and regional coral reef data to simulate eight spawning events from 2008-2011, applying a maximum 30-day pelagic larval duration and 20{\%} mortality rate. Coral larval dispersal patterns were analyzed between coral reefs across jurisdictional marine zones to identify spatial relationships between larval sources and destinations within countries and territories across the region. We applied our results in Marxan, a conservation planning software tool, to identify a regional coral reef MPA network design that meets conservation goals, minimizes underlying threats, and maintains coral reef connectivity. Our results suggest that approximately 77{\%} of coral reefs identified as having a high regional connectivity value are not included in the existing MPA network. This research is unique because we quantify and report coral larval connectivity data by marine ecoregions and Exclusive Economic Zones (EZZ) and use this information to identify gaps in the current Caribbean-wide MPA network by integrating asymmetric connectivity information in Marxan to design a regional MPA network that includes important reef network connections. The identification of important reef connectivity metrics guides the selection of priority conservation areas and supports resilience at the whole system level into the future.},

abstract = {Landscape networks and ecosystems worldwide are undergoing changes that may impact in different ways relevant ecological processes such as gene flow, pollination, or wildlife dispersal. Amyriad of indices have been developed to characterize landscape patterns, but not all of them are equally suited to evaluate temporal changes in landscape connectivity as is increasingly needed for biodiversity monitoring and operational indicator delivery. Relevant advancements in this direction have been recently proposed based on graph theoretical methods to analyze landscape network connectivity and on the measurement of habitat availability at the landscape scale. Building from these developments, wemodify arecent index and present the equivalent connected area (ECA) index, defined as the size of a single patch (maximally connected) that would provide the same probability of connectivity than the actual habitat pattern in the landscape. The temporal changes in ECA can be directly compared with the changes in total habitat area. This allows for additional and straightforward insights on the degree to which the gains or losses in habitat amount can be beneficial or deleterious by affecting landscape elements that uphold connectivity in a wider landscape context. We provide a demonstrative example of application and interpretation of this index and approach to monitor changes in functional landscape connectivity. We focus on the trends in European forests at the province level in the period 1990-2000 from Corine land cover data, considering both changes in the forest spatial pattern and in the average permeability of the landscape matrix. The degree of connectivity was rather stable over most of the study area, with a slight overall increase in forest connectivity in Europe. However, a few countries and regions concentrated remarkably high changes in the analyzed period, particularly those with a low forest cover. The species traits also affected the responses to landscape pattern changes, which were more prominent for those species with limited dispersal abilities. We conclude discussing the potential of this approach for consistent indicator delivery, as well as the limitations and possibilities of application to a variety of situations, for which the required quantitative tools are freely available as open source projects. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A long-term record of surface currents from a high-frequency radar system, along with near-surface hydrographic transects, moored current meter records, and satellite imagery, are analyzed to determine the relative importance of river discharge, wind, and tides in driving the surface flow in the Fraser River plume. The observations show a great deal of oceanographic and instrumental variability. However, averaged quantities yielded robust results. The effect of river flow, which determines buoyancy and inertia near the river mouth, was found by taking a long-term average. The resulting flow field was dominated by a jet with two asymmetric gyres; the anticyclonic gyre to the north had flow speeds consistent with geostrophy. The mean flow speed near the river mouth was 14.3cms-1, while the flow further afield was 5cms-1 or less. Wind stress and surface currents were highly coherent in the subtidal frequency band. Northwesterly winds drive a surface flow to the southeast at speeds of nearly 30cms-1. Southeasterly winds drive a surface flow to the northwest at speeds reaching 20cms-1; however, there is more spatial variability in speed and direction relative to the northwesterly wind case. A harmonic analysis was used to extract the tidally driven flows. Ellipse parameters for the major tidal constituents varied considerably in both alignment and aspect ratio over the radar domain, in direct contrast to a barotropic model which predicted rectilinear flow along the Strait of Georgia. This is a result of water filling and draining the shallow mud flats north of the Fraser's main channel. The M2 velocities at the surface were also weaker than their barotropic counterparts. However, the shallow water constituent MK3 was enhanced at the surface and nearly as strong as the mean flow, implying that non-linear interactions are important to surface dynamics.},

Previous studies indicate that the wave-induced drift (i.e., Stokes drift) is relevant for the transport of particles in the upper ocean. We use an ocean general circulation model together with a numerical wave prediction model and a Lagrangian particle tracking model to calculate trajectories of fish eggs and larvae. Waves are considered not only for particle drift but also for the air-sea momentum flux, its contribution to the Coriolis force, and vertical mixing. The sample species provides the advantage that many of its physical and behavioral properties are well known (e.g., egg buoyancy), allowing investigation of vertical particle displacement by turbulent mixing in response to wind forcing and wave breaking. The approach accounting for particle mixing by breaking waves enhances agreement between observed and modeled egg profiles. Results also show a general shoreward transport of particles by the Stokes drift. This wave drift exhibits a more constant direction than the Eulerian current and hence stabilizes particle diffusion to favor a dominant direction. For the case of Northeast Arctic cod, waves concentrated model eggs and larvae on average 1.5 km closer to shore, which is 20{\%} of their total distance to the coast. This increases the residence time of first-feeding larvae close to the spawning areas compared to earlier models. {\textcopyright} 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {The dynamics of species in communities and of alleles in populations are often described by strikingly similar models in ecology and genetics, respectively. The balance between colonization and extinction in MacArthur and Wilson's Theory of Island Biogeography, for example, is closely analogous to the balance between migration and drift in Sewall Wright's mainland-island model in population genetics. Similarly, MacArthur and Wilson's model for predicting the probability of successful species colonization is closely analogous to mutation- fixation models in population genetics, which were developed some 40 years earlier. Closer examination of these parallels reveals some genetic results that may provide novel lessons for ecology. In particular, the classic island-biogeographic prediction of steeper species-area curves on more isolated islands, for which empirical support is limited, does not follow from analogous models in population genetics. Rather, a simple extension of the genetic neutral theory predicts parallel species-area curves at different levels of isolation. In addition, starting from the premise that invading species in communities are analogous to new mutations in populations, genetic models make some non-intuitive predictions concerning the effects of recipient community size on the probability of successful invasion. More broadly, the parallels between population genetics and community ecology suggest that the seeming lack of a general conceptual framework in community ecology might be due to an emphasis on the study of patterns (which are highly contingent) rather than basic processes (which are far more general). Much as in population genetics, only four processes – defined appropriately for communities – lead to changes in the diversity and abundances of species at different scales: speciation, drift, migration, and selection.

abstract = {This review provides an integrated synthesis with timelines and evaluations of ecological responses to eutrophication in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the USA. Analyses of dated sediment cores reveal initial evidence of organic enrichment in ∼200 yr old strata, while signs of increased phytoplankton and decreased water clarity first appeared ∼100 yr ago. Severe, recurring deep-water hypoxia and loss of diverse submersed vascular plants were first evident in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. The degradation of these benthic habitats has contributed to declines in benthic macro-infauna in deep mesohaline regions of the Bay and blue crabs in shallow polyhaline areas. In contrast, copepods, which are heavily consumed in pelagic food chains, are relatively unaffected by nutrient-induced changes in phytoplankton. Intense mortality associated with fisheries and disease have caused a dramatic decline in eastern oyster stocks and associated Bay water filtration, which may have exacerbated eutrophication effects on phytoplankton and water clarity. Extensive tidal marshes, which have served as effective nutrient buffers along the Bay margins, are now being lost with rising sea level. Although the Bay's overall fisheries production has probably not been affected by eutrophication, decreases in the relative contribution of demersal fish and in the efficiency with which primary production is transferred to harvest suggest fundamental shifts in trophic and habitat structures. Bay ecosystem responses to changes in nutrient loading are complicated by non-linear feedback mechanisms, including particle trapping and binding by benthic plants that increase water clarity, and by oxygen effects on benthic nutrient recycling efficiency. Observations in Bay tributaries undergoing recent reductions in nutrient input indicate relatively rapid recovery of some ecosystem functions but lags in the response of others. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2005.},

Managing and conserving these systems in the face of uncertainty remains a daunting challenge, particularly with respect to developing networks of marine reserves. Here we review several modelling frameworks that explicitly acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty, and then use these methods to evaluate reserve spacing rules given increasing levels of uncertainty about larval dispersal distances. Our approach finds similar spacing rules as have been proposed elsewhere - roughly 20-200 km - but highlights several advantages provided by uncertainty modelling over more traditional approaches to developing these estimates. In particular, we argue that uncertainty modelling can allow for (1) an evaluation of the risk associated with any decision based on the assumed uncertainty; (2) a method for quantifying the costs and benefits of reducing uncertainty; and (3) a useful tool for communicating to stakeholders the challenges in managing highly uncertain systems. We also argue that incorporating rather than avoiding uncertainty will increase the chances of successfully achieving conservation and management goals.},

abstract = {Organic carbon (OC) storage in coastal vegetated ecosystems is increasingly being considered in carbon financing and climate change mitigation strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity in these “blue carbon” stocks among and within habitats has only recently been examined, despite its considerable implications. Seagrass meadows have potential to store significant amounts of carbon in their sediments, yet studies comparing sediment OC content at regional and meadow scales remain sparse. Here, we collected sediment cores from six temperate eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, to quantify sediment OC stocks, accumulation rates, and sources, and to examine local and regional drivers of variability. Sediment OC content was highly variable—across all sites, stocks in the top 0–5 cm ranged from 83 to 1089 g OC m−2, while the 15–20 cm stocks exhibited a 24‐fold difference, from 59 to 1407 g OC m−2. Carbon accumulation rates ranged from 4 to 33 g OC m−2 yr−1. Isotopic mixing models revealed that sediment OC was primarily terrestrial carbon (41.3{\%}) and canopy‐forming kelps (33.3{\%}), with a smaller contribution of eelgrass (25.3{\%}). Here, we show that regional variability in OC content exceeds meadow‐scale variability. This result is likely driven by landscape factors, most notably relative water motion, representing a more dominant control on seagrass OC accumulation than meadow‐scale factors such as canopy complexity. These findings elicit caution when scaling up seagrass meadow OC content and demonstrate that measures of the hydrodynamic environment could improve estimates of carbon storage in temperate soft sediment habitats.},

Zostera japonica is an intertidal seagrass with a wide latitudinal distribution expanding from tropical to temperate zones in its native range in Asia, with an additional non-native distribution in North America. We collated available data on phenological traits (timings of peak biomass or reproduction, durations of biomass growth and reproductive season, and maximum biomass or reproductive ratio) from publications and our own observations. Traits were compared among geographic groups: Asia-tropical, Asia-temperate, and North America-temperate. We further examined relationships between traits and latitude and temperature for 3 population groups: Asian, North American, and all populations. Our analysis revealed significant variation among geographic groups in maximum biomass, peak reproductive timing, and maximum reproductive ratio, but not in other traits. Maximum biomass and peak reproductive timing for Asian and all populations were significantly correlated with latitude and temperature. Maximum biomass was highest at mid-latitudes or intermediate temperatures and decreased toward distribution range limits, and peak reproductive timing occurred later in the year at higher latitudes or cooler sites. North American populations showed shorter growth durations and greater reproductive ratios at higher latitude. Different responses observed for North American populations may reflect effects of introduction. Our study demonstrates potential variation among geographic regions and between native and non-native populations. },

Moreover, projected warming rates and the existing ‘community thermal safety margin' (the inherent buffer against warming based on the thermal sensitivity of constituent species) both vary among ecoregions and with latitude. The community thermal safety margin will be exceeded by 2050 in the tropics and by 2150 for many higher latitude MPAs. Importantly, the spatial distribution of emergence is stressor-specific. Hence, rearranging MPAs to minimize exposure to one stressor could well increase exposure to another.

Many countries, including Canada, have committed to protecting at least 10{\%} of their marine areas under the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11, which includes connectivity as a key aspect. Connectivity, the movement of individuals among habitats, can enhance population stability and resilience within and among MPAs. However, little is known about regional spatial patterns of marine ecological connectivity, particularly adult movement. We developed a method to assess and design MPA networks that maximize inferred connectivity within habitat types for adult movement when ecological data are limited. We used the Northern Shelf Bioregion in British Columbia, Canada, to explore two different approaches: (1) evaluating sites important for inferred regional connectivity (termed hotspots) and (2) assessing MPA network configurations based on their overlap with connectivity hotspots and interconnectedness between MPAs. To assess inferred connectivity via adult movement, we used two different threshold distances (15 and 50 km) to capture moderate home ranges, which are most appropriate to consider in MPA design. We applied graph theory to assess inferred connectivity within 16 habitat and depth categories (proxies for distinct ecological communities), and used novel multiplex network methodologies to perform an aggregated assessment of inferred connectivity. We evaluated inferred regional connectivity hotspots based on betweenness and eigenvector centrality metrics, finding that the existing MPA network overlapped a moderate proportion of these regional hotspots and identified key areas to be considered as candidate MPAs. Network density among existing MPAs was low within the individual habitat networks, as well as the multiplex. This work informs an ongoing MPA planning process, and approaches for incorporating connectivity into MPA design when data are limited, with lessons for other contexts.},

abstract = {Quantifying the probability of larval exchange among marine populations is key to predicting local population dynamics and optimizing networks of marine protected areas. The pattern of connectivity among populations can be described by the measurement of a dispersal kernel. However, a statistically robust, empirical dispersal kernel has been lacking for any marine species. Here, we use genetic parentage analysis to quantify a dispersal kernel for the reef fish Elacatinus lori, demonstrating that dispersal declines exponentially with distance. The spatial scale of dispersal is an order of magnitude less than previous estimates—the median dispersal distance is just 1.7 km and no dispersal events exceed 16.4 km despite intensive sampling out to 30 km from source. Overlaid on this strong pattern is subtle spatial variation, but neither pelagic larval duration nor direction is associated with the probability of successful dispersal. Given the strong relationship between distance and dispersal, we show that distance-driven logistic models have strong power to predict dispersal probabilities. Moreover, connectivity matrices generated from these models are congruent with empirical estimates of spatial genetic structure, suggesting that the pattern of dispersal we uncovered reflects long-term patterns of gene flow. These results challenge assumptions regarding the spatial scale and presumed predictors of marine population connectivity. We conclude that if marine reserve networks aim to connect whole communities of fishes and conserve biodiversity broadly, then reserves that are close in space ({\textless}10 km) will accommodate those members of the community that are shortdistance dispersers.},

Although there is evidence that coral reefs thrive under certain conditions (eg moderate water temperatures, limited fishing pressure), the dynamic processes that promote ecosystem functioning and its internal drivers (ie community structure) are poorly defined and explored. Specifically, despite decades of research suggesting a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across biomes, few studies have explored this relationship in coral reef systems. We propose a practical definition of coral reef functioning, centered on eight complementary ecological processes: calcium carbonate production and bioerosion, primary production and herbivory, secondary production and predation, and nutrient uptake and release. Connecting research on species niches, functional diversity of communities, and rates of the eight key processes can provide a novel, quantitative understanding of reef functioning and its dependence on coral reef communities that will chart the transition of coral reefs in the Anthropocene. This will contribute urgently needed guidance for the management of these important ecosystems.},

abstract = {Field experiments utilizing peak nighttime activity levels of amphipods were performed to determine if the spatial location of drift macroalgae in seagrass landscapes affected amphipod abundance on drift macroalgae. The study was conducted in Tampa Bay, FL over two nights in August 1995, within a Halodule wrightii Ascherson Phillips seagrass bed. Amphipod utilization of drift algae was assessed by defaunating the drift alga, Hypnea cervicornis J. Agardh, and recording net faunal movement onto algal clumps which were (1) stationary in bare sediment for 120 min; (2) stationary in H. wrightii for 120 min; (3) moved through H. wrightii for 90 min; and (4) moved through H. wrightii for 90 min and then across the seagrass sand ecotone and into bare sediment for 30 min. Amphipods, almost exclusively epiphytic taxa, were recovered from all experimental algal clumps placed both in seagrass and sand areas. Fourteen amphipod species were recovered with Ampithoe longimana and Cymadusa compta making up 77{\%} of the total abundance. Greater abundances (but not diversity) of epifaunal amphipods were found on algae when they were located within a seagrass bed compared to bare sediment. Drift algal clumps that passed through the seagrass/sand ecotone had significantly higher amphipod abundance than (1) clumps that did not move through seagrass and were stationary in bare sediment and (2) clumps which moved through, but not out of, a seagrass bed. Demographic and ontogenetic differences were also detected among drift algal treatments. Gravid females were less abundant on algae that did not remain within or was not inside of the seagrass bed and proportionately more males and juveniles were found on algal clumps anchored away from seagrass vegetation. These findings demonstrate that drift algae acting as a mobile corridor provide epiphytal amphipods with a mechanism for dispersal within a seagrass landscape. Moreover, the drift algae that serve as a mobile corridor also act as a mechanism whereby the exchange of fauna is enhanced as drift algae move across the seagrass/sand ecotone. Thus, factors controlling drift algae movement, such as regional meteorological conditions, should have implications for interpatch dynamics of amphipods within a seagrass landscape. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We explored three applications of SDMs: first a model tested at a scale smaller than at which it was trained (downscaled), second a model tested at scale larger than its training scale (upscaled), and third a model tested at the same scale but outside the extent for which it was trained (transferred). The accuracies of these models were compared with the 'reference' models that were trained and tested at the same scale and extent. We found that downscaled SDMs had higher predictive accuracy than reference SDMs. Transferred and upscaled models had lower predictive accuracy than their reference counterparts but still performed better than random, making them potentially acceptable alternatives where information is lacking for imminent decisions or in cost-restricted scenarios. Our results provide insights into the techniques available for researchers and managers developing SDMs at varying scales, with different species, and with different levels of initial information.

abstract = {Understanding the movement of genes and individuals across marine seascapes is a long-standing challenge in marine ecology, and can inform our understanding of local adaptation, the persistence and movement of populations, and the spatial scale of effective management. Patterns of gene flow in the ocean are often inferred based on population genetic analyses coupled with knowledge of species' dispersive life histories. However, genetic structure is the result of time-integrated processes, and may not capture present-day connectivity between populations. Here we use a high-resolution oceanographic circulation model to predict larval dispersal along the complex coastline of western Canada that includes the transition between two well-studied zoogeographic provinces. We simulate dispersal in a benthic sea star with a 6-10 week pelagic larval phase, and test predictions of this model against previously observed genetic structure including a strong phylogeographic break within the zoogeographical transition zone. We also test predictions with new genetic sampling in a site within the phylogeographic break. We find that the coupled genetic and circulation model predicts the high degree of genetic structure observed in this species, despite its long pelagic duration. High genetic structure on this complex coastline can thus be explained through ocean circulation patterns which tend to retain passive larvae within 20 - 50 km of their parents, suggesting a necessity for close-knit design of Marine Protected Area networks.

abstract = {Ecologists and conservation biologists have used many measures of landscape structure to predict the population dynamic consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation, but these measures are not well justified by population dynamic theory. Here we introduce a new measure for highly fragmented landscapes, termed the metapopulation capacity, which is rigorously derived from metapopulation theory and can easily be applied to real networks of habitat fragments with known areas and connectivities. Technically, metapopulation capacity is the leading eigenvalue of an appropriate 'landscape' matrix. A species is predicted to persist in a landscape if the metapopulation capacity of that landscape is greater than a threshold value determined by the properties of the species. Therefore, metapopulation capacity can conveniently be used to rank different landscapes in terms of their capacity to support viable metapopulations. We present an empirical example on multiple networks occupied by an endangered species of butterfly. Using this theory, we may also calculate how the metapopulation capacity is changed by removing habitat fragments from or adding new ones into specific spatial locations, or by changing their areas. The metapopulation capacity should find many applications in metapopulation ecology, landscape ecology and conservation biology.},

abstract = {Developing networks of no-take marine reserves is often hindered by uncertainty in the extent to which local marine populations are connected to one another through larval dispersal and recruitment (connectivity). While patterns of connectivity can be predicted by larval dispersal models and validated by empirical methods, biogeographic approaches have rarely been used to investigate connectivity at spatial scales relevant to reserve networks (10's-100's of km). Here, species assemblage patterns in coral reef fish were used together with an individual-based model of dispersal of reef fish larvae to infer patterns of connectivity in a ∼300 km wide region in the Philippines that included the Bohol Sea and adjacent bodies of water. A dominant current flows through the study region, which may facilitate connectivity among {\textgreater}100 no-take reserves. Connectivity was first investigated by analysing data on the presence/absence of 216 species of reef fish and habitat variables across 61 sites. Hierarchical clustering of sites reflecting species assemblage patterns distinguished a major group of sites in the Bohol Sea (Bray-Curtis similarity {\textgreater}70{\%}) from sites situated in adjacent bodies of water (bays, channels between islands and a local sea). The grouping of sites could be partly explained by a combination of degree of embayment, {\%} cover of sand and {\%} cover of rubble (Spearman rank correlation, $\rho$w= 0.42). The individual-based model simulated dispersal of reef fish larvae monthly for three consecutive years in the region. The results of simulations, using a range of pelagic larval durations (15-45 days), were consistent with the species assemblage patterns. Sites in the model that showed strongest potential connectivity corresponded to the majority of sites that comprised the Bohol Sea group suggested by hierarchical clustering. Most sites in the model that exhibited weak connectivity were groups of sites which had fish assemblages that were least similar to those in the Bohol Sea group. Concurrent findings from the two approaches suggest a strong influence of local oceanography and geography on broad spatial patterns of connectivity. The predictions can be used as an initial basis to organise existing reserves to form ecologically meaningful networks. This study showed that species assemblage patterns could be a viable supplementary indicator of connectivity if used together with predictions from a larval dispersal model and if the potential effect of habitat on the structuring of species assemblages is taken into consideration.},

For many wild living species, local extinctions of fragmented populations are common and recolonization is critical for regional survival. Successful recolonization depends on the availability of dispersing individuals and the degree of landscape connectivity. The obvious implications of landscape connectivity for conservation biology have led to a proliferation of connectivity measures. However, general relationships between landscape connectivity and landscape structure are lacking, and so are the relationships between different connectivity metrics. Consequently, there is a need to develop landscape metrics that more accurately characterize the land- scape with an emphasis on the underlying processes. Here we review various definitions of landscape connectivity, explain their mathematical connota- tions, and make some unifying conclusions and suggestions for future research.},

abstract = {A new conceptual framework is presented for the assessment of the impacts of environmental change drivers on ecosystem service provision and the policy and management responses that would derive from the valuation of these impacts. The Framework for Ecosystem Service Provision (FESP), is based on an interpretation of the widely-used Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. FESP differs from the DPSIR by offering clarity in the definitions of the various DPSIR components as well as introducing novel elements of relevance to the ecosystem service approach. The value of a common framework lies in making the comparison across competing services accessible and clear as well as highlighting the conflicts and trade-offs between not only multiple ecosystem services, but also multiple service beneficiaries. The framework is explicit, for example, in recognising as state variables not only the attributes of the Ecosystem Service Providers (ESPs), but also the attributes of the Ecosystem Service Beneficiaries (ESBs). That a service depends as much on the attributes of the people whose well-being benefits from the service as on the attributes of the biology providing the service is an important step in integrated social-ecological thinking. FESP also identifies the mechanisms of either mitigation or adaptation to the environmental change problem through the effect of these response strategies on specific pressure or state variables. In this way, FESP can contribute to the policies and strategies that are used to support conservation management. This paper describes the principles of FESP and presents some indicative examples of its practical implementation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Spatial conservation prioritization addresses the question of how we should allocate conservation effort and funds in space and time. While the benefits of quantitative conservation prioritization methods have been widely promoted, adoption of these methods in "real-world" planning and implementation is still in its infancy, partly due to the difficulty of identifying which methods and tools (if any) are suited to specific planning problems. Spatial Conservation Prioritization brings together a team of leading scientists to introduce the conceptual and methodological aspects of how to undertake spatial conservation planning in a quantitative manner. It provides the reader with information on when, why, and how to use which statistical and computational methods for conservation prioritization. Important topics underlying spatial prioritization including metapopulation modelling, population viability analysis modelling, species distribution modelling, and uncertainty analysis are discussed, as well as operational definitions and methods.

However, different responses of species to warming and changed species interactions make predicting biodiversity redistribution and relative abundance a challenge3,4. Here, we use three decades of fish and plankton survey data to assess how warming changes the relative dominance of warm-affinity and cold-affinity species5,6. Regions with stable temperatures (for example, the Northeast Pacific and Gulf of Mexico) show little change in dominance structure, while areas with warming (for example, the North Atlantic) see strong shifts towards warm-water species dominance. Importantly, communities whose species pools had diverse thermal affinities and a narrower range of thermal tolerance showed greater sensitivity, as anticipated from simulations. The composition of fish communities changed less than expected in regions with strong temperature depth gradients. There, species track temperatures by moving deeper2,7, rather than horizontally, analogous to elevation shifts in land plants8. Temperature thus emerges as a fundamental driver for change in marine systems, with predictable restructuring of communities in the most rapidly warming areas using metrics based on species thermal affinities. The ready and predictable dominance shifts suggest a strong prognosis of resilience to climate change for these communities.},

The physical model is a one-dimensional vertical mixing model, using a K-profile parametrization of the boundary layer, forced with high frequency meteorological data. The biological model includes one phytoplankton class (microphytoplankton) and one nutrient source (nitrate). The spring bloom in the SoG occurs when phytoplankton receive enough light that their growth rates exceed their loss rates. The amount of light that the phytoplankton receive is a function of solar radiation and the depth of mixing. The model was used to determine what physical factors are controlling the phytoplankton losses and the light received by the phytoplankton. Wind was found to control the spring bloom arrival time, with strong winds increasing the mixing-layer depth and delaying the bloom. The amount of incoming solar irradiance, through amount of cloud cover, had a secondary effect. The freshwater input (primarily Fraser River discharge) had an insignificant effect on the timing. Increased freshwater flux increases the buoyancy flux and thus decreases the mixing-layer depth but also increases the strength of the estuarine circulation, increasing the advective loss.},

Then, we illustrate the performance of these new and modified metrics with an age-struc- tured metapopulation model for a real-world marine reserve network case study, and we evaluate the robustness of our findings by systematically varying particular features of that network.

Existing metrics become good predictors of persistence only when self-connections are entirely absent, an unrealistic scenario in the overwhelming major- ity of metapopulation applications.

abstract = {Eelgrass Zostera marina L. meadows are major structural and trophic components of coastal ecosystems. The role of eelgrass in ecosystem functioning depends on biomass and production of the meadows, which can fluctuate greatly during an annual cycle and be major temporal drivers of changes in the coastal zone. We analysed magnitude and seasonality of eelgrass aboveground biomass, shoot density and production across temperature and latitude gradients over the majority of the species' distributional range, and investigated to what extent temperature and/or light drive differences in these values. Eelgrass phenology (timing of peak biomass, start and end of the growing season) showed strong effects of temperature and latitude, indicating that seasonality was considerably advanced in warm areas at low latitudes compared to cold areas at high latitudes. Magnitude of peak aboveground biomass, length of the growing season, mean annual shoot density and aboveground production did not change significantly with either temperature or latitude, indicating that these parameters were controlled mainly by other factors. Annual variation in aboveground biomass and shoot density was significantly smaller in areas with low summer temperature, indicating that while warm-water populations may show substantial temporal variation in biomass, cold-water meadows are less dynamic. These findings were supported by cold-water populations having a larger mean annual biomass and a greater investment in belowground parts. In all significant regressions, temperature was a better predictor of population dynamics than latitude. This indicates that eelgrass phenology might advance considerably in response to global warming, and suggests that the distributional range of this species might be moving northwards. Given the key role of eelgrass in coastal ecosystems, these climate-induced changes might entail substantial impacts on waterbirds, fish, invertebrates and other organisms exploiting these meadows.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding the relative roles of species interactions and environmental factors in structuring communities has historically focused on local scales where manipulative experiments are possible. However, recent interest in predicting the effects of climate change and species invasions has spurred increasing attention to processes occurring at larger spatial and temporal scales. The ?meta-ecosystem? approach is an ideal framework for integrating processes operating at multiple scales as it explicitly considers the influence of local biotic interactions and regional flows of energy, materials, and organisms on community structure. Using a comparative-experimental design, we asked (1) what is the relative importance of local biotic interactions and oceanic processes in determining rocky intertidal community structure in the low zone within the Northern California Current System, and (2) what factors are most important in regulating this structure and why? We focused on functional group interactions between macrophytes and sessile invertebrates and their consumers (grazers, predators), how these varied across spatial scales, and with ocean-driven conditions (upwelling, temperature) and ecological subsidies (nutrients, phytoplankton, sessile invertebrate recruits). Experiments were conducted at 13 sites divided across four capes in Oregon and northern California. Results showed that biotic interactions were variable in space and time but overall, sessile invertebrates had no effect on macrophytes while macrophytes had weakly negative effects on sessile invertebrates. Consumers, particularly predators, also had weakly negative effects on both functional groups. Overall, we found that 40?49{\%} of the variance in community structure at the local scale was explained by external factors (e.g., spatial scale, time, upwelling, temperature, ecological subsidies) vs. 19?39{\%} explained by functional group interactions. When individual functional group interaction strengths were used, only 2?3{\%} of the variation was explained by any one functional group while 28?54{\%} of the variation was explained by external factors. We conclude that community structure in the low intertidal zone is driven primarily by external factors at the regional scale with local biotic interactions playing a secondary role.},

abstract = {Abstract The establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) is a critical step in ensuring the continued persistence of marine biodiversity. While the area protected within MPAs is growing, the movement of individuals (or larvae) among MPAs, termed connectivity, has only recently been included as an objective of many MPAs. As such, assessing connectivity is often neglected or over-simplified in the planning process. For promoting population persistence, it is important to ensure that protected areas within a system are functionally connected through dispersal or adult movement. Here, we present a multi-species model of larval dispersal for the Australian marine environment to evaluate how much local-scale connectivity is protected within MPAs and determine if the extensive system of MPAs truly functions as a network. The model focuses on non-migratory species with simplified larval behaviours (e.g., no explicit vertical migration) for this illustration. On the assumption of passive larval dispersal, our results suggest that Australia's MPA system cannot be referred to as a single network, but rather a collection of numerous smaller networks delineated by natural breaks in the connectivity of reef habitat. Of all the MPAs analysed (approximately 2.7 million km2), outside the Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo Reef, less than 50{\%} of MPAs (46-80{\%} of total MPA area depending on the species considered) were functionally connected. The need to first assess the underlying natural connectivity of a study system prior to implementing new MPAs represents a key research priority for strategically growing MPA networks. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multi-species connectivity into conservation planning to identify opportunities to better incorporate connectivity into the design of MPA systems, increasing their capacity to support long-term, sustainable biodiversity outcomes.

We used hierarchical joint species distribution modelling to understand the contribution of environmental conditions, spatial distance between meadows, and species co-occurrences to epifaunal invertebrate abundance and distribution across the region. We found that patterns of taxonomic compositional similarity among meadows were inconsistent with dispersal limitation, and meadows in the same region were often no more similar to each other than meadows over 1000 km away. Abiotic environmental conditions (temperature, dissolved oxygen) explained a small fraction of variation in taxonomic abundance patterns across the region. We found novel co-occurrence patterns among taxa that could not be explained by shared responses to environmental gradients, suggesting the possibility that interspecific interactions influence seagrass invertebrate abundance and distribution. Our results suggest that biodiversity and ecosystem functions provided by seagrass meadows reflect ecological processes occurring both within meadows and across seascapes and that management of eelgrass habitat for biodiversity may be most effective when both local and regional processes are considered. },

In coastal marine systems, fish, shark and mammal population declines are major drivers of recent ecosystem-level change. Cascading effects of predatory wading birds, however, are less understood, even though wading bird populations have declined in many regions. We quantified the effects of predation by the piscivorous great blue heron Ardea herodias fannini on fish, invertebrates and epiphytes living in eelgrass Zostera marina. We found that herons forage on benthic fish in seagrass meadows, and foraging intensity increased from late spring until midsummer. When we experimentally excluded herons, benthic fish abundance increased, and the invertebrate assemblage shifted to more shrimp-dominated assemblages while grazing gammarid amphipod abundance declined. These shifts were associated with reduced epiphyte abundance when herons were excluded, reflecting a four-level trophic cascade and mediated by shifts in the grazer assemblage. In summary, we found that a piscivorous wading bird species exerts top down control in a subtidal seagrass ecosystem. Losses and recovery of wading birds could have ecosystem-level ecological consequences that may need to be considered in the context of concern for overfishing and predator recovery in marine coastal management.},

abstract = {The emerging science and policy arena of marine ecosystem-based management is beset with the challenging question of how to assess the urgency of problems influencing different ecosystem components. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic and efficient framework to identify land- or sea-based activities that pose the greatest risk to valued members of marine ecosystems, including mammals, fishes, and invertebrates. Ecosystem-based risk is scored along two axes of information: the exposure of a population to an activity, and the sensitivity of the population to that activity, given a particular level of exposure. Risk is illustrated in a variety of ways, including two-dimensional contour plots and maps showing regional variation in risk. We apply this risk assessment framework to regional populations of indicator species in Puget Sound, WA, USA. This case study provides insight into how risk varies for particular activity-species combinations, and, because it is applied to indicator species, it also provides an estimate of how different activities influence risk to overall ecosystem structure and function. More generally, the risk assessment approach highlights the linkages between land-based activities and risk to marine species and can be used to evaluate the potential impacts of a diversity of human activities on coastal oceans. The framework is scalable, transparent, and repeatable and can be used now to facilitate the implementation of ecosystem-based management, including integrated ecosystem assessments and coastal and marine spatial planning. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

We assessed whether SSRs allow managers to design effective MPA networks under spatiotemporally varying dispersal patterns using a spatially realistic popula- tion model parameterized for a commercially-exploited fish species on the Great Barrier Reef. 3. SSRs are used to design MPA networks, and population simulations are used to measure the mean and variance of the resulting population size and fishery catch. 4.

For example, in the absence of connectivity data, a “many small” MPAs rule provides the least variable management outcome. 5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that the performance and usefulness of size and spacing rules (SSRs) as guidelines for marine protected areas (MPAs) de- pend on the level of knowledge about larval dispersal, as well as the level of current exploitation in the fishery.

PA and lethal factor when added together are cytolytic to mouse macrophages and 577408 macrophage cell line. This in vitro lethal toxicity assay is very useful in understanding the molecular mechanism of action of lethal toxin. Effective utilization of PA is, however, hampered due to its thermolability. On prolonged storage at 37 " C, PA was found to lose its activity almost completely. The effect of solvent additives like trehalose, sorbitol, xylitol, sodium citrate and magnesium sulphate on the thermal stabilization of PA was examined. The results indicated an increase in the stability of PA when the incubation at 37°C was carried out in the presence of solvent additives used in the l-3 M range. Magnesium sulphate helped retain the activity up to 82.7{\%} against the control in which no additive was used, as judged by cytolytic assay using J774G8 macrophage cell line. Trehalose or sodium citrate also showed an appreciable protection of PA activity, while sorbitol or xylitol were not very effective. Competitive binding assay using radiolabeled PA showed that PA had lost capacity of binding to macrophage cells on prolonged incubation at 37°C. Circular dichroism results at 4, 18 and 37°C indicated an increase in secondary structure at 37°C relative to that at 4 or 18 " C, supporting the activity data.},

abstract = {Many biological systems, from fragmented landscapes to host populations, can be represented as networks of connected habitat patches. Links between patches in these connectivity networks can represent equally diverse processes, from individuals moving through the landscape to pathogen transmissions or successive colonization events in metapopulations. Any of these processes can be characterized as stochastic, with functional links among patches that exist with various levels of certainty. This stochasticity then needs to be reflected in the algorithms that aim to predict the dispersal routes in these networks. Herewe adapt the concept of reliability to characterize the likelihood that a specific path will be used for dispersal in a probabilistic connectivity network. The most reliable of the paths that connect two patches will then identify the most likely sequence of intermediate steps between these patches. Path reliability will be sensitive to targeted disruptions of individual links that form the path, and this can then be used to plan the interventions aimed at either preserving or disrupting the dispersal along that path. The proposed approach is general, and can be used to identify the most likely dispersal routes in various contexts, such as predicting patterns of migrations, colonizations, invasions and epidemics.},

abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are recognized as the flagship tool to offset biodiversity loss on Earth. Spatial conservation planning seeks optimal designs of PAs that meet multiple targets such as biodiversity representation and population persistence. Since connectivity between PAs is a fundamental requirement for population persistence, several methods have been developed to include connectivity into PA design algorithms. Among these, the eigenvalue decomposition of the connectivity matrix allows for identifying clusters of strongly connected sites and selecting the sites contributing the most to population persistence. So far, this method was only suited to optimize an entire network of PAs without considering existing PAs in the new design. However, a more cost-effective and realistic approach is to optimize the design of an extended network to improve its connectivity and thus population persistence. Here, we develop a flexible algorithm based on eigenvalue decomposition of connectivity matrices to extend existing networks of PAs while optimizing connectivity and population growth rate. We also include a splitting algorithm to improve cluster identification. The new algorithm accounts for the change in connectivity due to the increased biological productivity often observed in existing PAs. We illustrate the potential of our algorithm by proposing an extension of the network of ∼100 Mediterranean marine PAs to reach the targeted 10{\%} surface area protection from the current 1.8{\%}. We identify differences between the clean slate scenario, where all sites are available for protection, irrespective of their current protection status, and the scenario where existing PAs are forced to be included into the optimized solution. By integrating this algorithm to existing multi-objective and multi-specific algorithms of PA selection, the demographic effects of connectivity can be explicitly included into conservation planning.},

In addition to self-recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems. The results reveal distinct regions of population isolation based on larval dispersal that also correspond to genetic and morphological clines observed across a range of marine organisms.},

Although seagrass communities have been well-studied in the field, a quantification of their food-web structure and functioning, and how these change across space and human impacts has been lacking. Motivated by extensive field surveys and literature information, we analyzed the structural features of food webs associated with Zostera marina across 16 study sites in 3 provinces in Atlantic Canada. Our goals were to (i) quantify differences in food-web structure across local and regional scales and human impacts, (ii) assess the robustness of seagrass webs to simulated species loss, and (iii) compare food-web structure in temperate Atlantic seagrass beds with those of other aquatic ecosystems. We constructed individual food webs for each study site and cumulative webs for each province and the entire region based on presence/absence of species, and calculated 16 structural properties for each web. Our results indicate that food-web structure was similar among low impact sites across regions. With increasing human impacts associated with eutrophication, however, food-web structure show evidence of degradation as indicated by fewer trophic groups, lower maximum trophic level of the highest top predator, fewer trophic links connecting top to basal species, higher fractions of herbivores and intermediate consumers, and higher number of prey per species. These structural changes translate into functional changes with impacted sites being less robust to simulated species loss. Temperate Atlantic seagrass webs are similar to a tropical seagrass web, yet differed from other aquatic webs, suggesting consistent food-web characteristics across seagrass ecosystems in different regions. Our study illustrates that food-web structure and functioning of seagrass habitats change with human impacts and that the spatial scale of food-web analysis is critical for determining results.},

abstract = { Well-managed and enforced no-take marine reserves generate important larval subsidies to neighboring habitats and thereby contribute to the long-term sustainability of fisheries. However, larval dispersal patterns are variable, which leads to temporal fluctuations in the contribution of a single reserve to the replenishment of local populations. Identifying management strategies that mitigate the uncertainty in larval supply will help ensure the stability of recruitment dynamics and minimize the volatility in fishery catches. Here, we use genetic parentage analysis to show extreme variability in both the dispersal patterns and recruitment contribution of four individual marine reserves across six discrete recruitment cohorts for coral grouper ( Plectropomus maculatus ) on the Great Barrier Reef. Together, however, the asynchronous contributions from multiple reserves create temporal stability in recruitment via a connectivity portfolio effect. This dampening effect reduces the variability in larval supply from individual reserves by a factor of 1.8, which effectively halves the uncertainty in the recruitment contribution of individual reserves. Thus, not only does the network of four marine reserves generate valuable larval subsidies to neighboring habitats, the aggregate effect of individual reserves mitigates temporal fluctuations in dispersal patterns and the replenishment of local populations. Our results indicate that small networks of marine reserves yield previously unrecognized stabilizing benefits that ensure a consistent larval supply to replenish exploited fish stocks. },

All ecological MPAs – no matter their specific focus or objectives – depend for their success on incorporating ecological spatial connectivity into their design, use (i.e. application), and management. 3 Though important, a synthesis of the implications of ecological spatial connectivity for the design, use, and management of MPAs, especially in the face of a changing global climate, does not exist. We synthesize this information and distill it into practical principles for design, use, and management of MPAs and networks of MPAs. 4 High population connectivity among distant coastal ecosystems underscores the critical value of MPA networks for MPAs and the populations and ecosystems between them. 5 High ecosystem connectivity among coastal ecosystems underscores the importance of protecting multiple connected ecosystems within an MPA, maximizing ecosystem connectivity across MPAs, and managing ecosystems outside MPAs so as to minimize influxes of detrimen- tal organisms and materials into MPAs. 6 Connectivity‐informed MPAs and MPA networks – designed and managed to foster the ecological spatial connectivity processes important to local populations, species, communities, and ecosystems – can best address ecological changes induced by climate change. Also, the protections afforded by MPAs from direct, local human impacts may ameliorate climate change impacts in coastal ecosystems inside MPAs and, indirectly, in ecosystems outside MPAs.},

Although the importance of information to ecological function has been widely recognized, the fundamental principles of ecological science as commonly expressed do not reflect this central role of information processing. We articulate five fundamental principles of ecology that integrate information with energy and material constraints across scales of organization in living systems. We show how these principles outline new theoretical and empirical research challenges, and offer one novel attempt to incorporate them in a theoretical model. To provide adequate background for the principles, we review major concepts and identify common themes and key differences in information theories spanning physics, biology and semiotics. We structured our review around a series of questions about the role information may play in ecological systems: i) what is information? ii) how is information related to uncertainty? iii) what is information processing? iv) does information processing link ecological systems across scales? We highlight two aspects of information that capture its dual roles: syntactic information defining the processes that encode, filter and process information stored in biological structure and semiotic information associated with structures and their context. We argue that the principles of information in living systems promote a unified approach to understanding living systems in terms of first principles of biology and physics, and promote much needed theoretical and empirical advances in ecological research to unify understanding across disciplines and scales.},

Indeed, ‘animal personalities' (also called behavioural syndromes, temperament, or coping styles) have been described in a huge variety of (more than 300) species, ranging from spiders to bumblebees, from octopuses to sticklebacks, and from mice to monkeys (e.g., Clark {\&} Ehlinger 1987, Digman 1990, Gosling 2001, Sih et al. 2004a). Examples abound. Birds of a similar phenotype differ consistently in the way they explore their environment and these differences are associated with, for example, differences in boldness and aggressiveness (Groothuis {\&} Carere 2005). Rodents as mice and rats differ consistently in the way they deal with environmental challenges and such differences encompass differences in social tolerance, aggressiveness, cooperative breeding and even nest-building behaviour (Koolhaas et al. 1999).},

abstract = {The Strait of Georgia is a large, semi-enclosed body of water between Vancouver Island and the mainland of British Columbia connected to the Pacific Ocean via Juan de Fuca Strait at the south and Johnstone Strait at the north. During the winter months, coastal communities along the Strait of Georgia are at risk of flooding caused by storm surges, a natural hazard that can occur when a strong storm coincides with high tide. This investigation produces storm surge hindcasts using a three-dimensional numerical ocean model for the Strait of Georgia and the surrounding bodies of water (Juan de Fuca Strait, Puget Sound, and Johnstone Strait) collectively known as the Salish Sea. The numerical model employs the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean architecture in a regional configuration. The model is evaluated through comparisons of tidal elevation harmonics and storm surge with observations. Important forcing factors contributing to storm surges are assessed. It is shown that surges entering the domain from the Pacific Ocean make the most significant contribution to surge amplitude within the Strait of Georgia. Comparisons between simulations and high-resolution and low-resolution atmospheric forcing further emphasize that remote forcing is the dominant factor in surge amplitudes in this region. In addition, local wind patterns caused a slight increase in surge amplitude on the mainland side of the Strait of Georgia compared with Vancouver Island coastal areas during a major wind storm on 15 December 2006. Generally, surge amplitudes are found to be greater within the Strait of Georgia than in Juan de Fuca Strait.},

Metabolic theory predicts that many rates increase exponentially with temperature following an activation energy (E) of 0.32 eV for photosynthesis. Here, I evaluate this prediction for net photosynthesis and organ, individual, and ecosystem growth. Observed E for photosynthesis varied widely but was not statistically different from predictions, while E for organs was greater than predicted, and E for individuals and ecosystems only weakly characterized temperature responses. I review several hypotheses that may underlie these results. Understanding how multiple rate-limiting processes coalesce into a single E that characterizes metabolic responses to temperature, and how to best estimate E from unimodal data, remain important challenges.},

Understanding how connectivity patterns emerge from physically and biologically-mediated interactions is therefore crucial to conserve marine ecosystem functions and biodiversity. Here, we develop a set of biophysical models to explore connectivity in assemblages of species belonging to a typical Mediterranean community (Posidonia oceanica meadows) and characterized by different dispersing traits. We propose a novel methodological framework to synthesize species-specific results into a set of community connectivity metrics and show that spatiotemporal variation in magnitude and direction of the connections, as well as interspecific differences in dispersing traits, are key factors structuring community connectivity. We eventually demonstrate how these metrics can be used to characterize the functional role of each marine area in determining patterns of community connectivity at the basin level and to support marine conservation planning.},

However, empirical tests of this relationship have yielded mixed results, and alternative hypotheses have rarely been considered. Here we assess the relative influence of adult and larval-traits on geographic range size using a global dataset encompassing 590 species of tropical reef fishes in 47 families, the largest compilation of such data to date for any marine group. We analyze this database using linear mixed-effect models to control for phylogeny and geographical limits on range size. Our analysis indicates that three adult traits likely to affect the capacity of new colonizers to survive and establish reproductive populations (body size, schooling behavior, and nocturnal activity) are equal or better predictors of geographic range size than pelagic larval duration. We conclude that adult life-history traits that affect the postdispersal persistence of new populations are primary determinants of successful range extension and, consequently, of geographic range size among tropical reef fishes.},

abstract = {Human-driven habitat fragmentation is cited as one of the most pressing threats facing many coastal ecosystems today. Many experiments have explored the consequences of fragmentation on fauna in one foundational habitat, seagrass beds, but have either surveyed along a gradient of existing patchiness, used artificial materials to mimic a natural bed, or sampled over short timescales. Here, we describe faunal responses to constructed fragmented landscapes varying from 4–400 m2 in two transplant garden experiments incorporating live eelgrass (Zostera marina L.). In experiments replicated within two subestuaries of the Chesapeake Bay, USA across multiple seasons and non-consecutive years, we comprehensively censused mesopredators and epifaunal communities using complementary quantitative methods. We found that community properties, including abundance, species richness, Simpson and functional diversity, and composition were generally unaffected by the number of patches and the size of the landscape, or the intensity of sampling. Additionally, an index of competition based on species co-occurrences revealed no trends with increasing patch size, contrary to theoretical predictions. We extend conclusions concerning the invariance of animal communities to habitat fragmentation from small-scale observational surveys and artificial experiments to experiments conducted with actual living plants and at more realistic scales. Our findings are likely a consequence of the rapid life histories and high mobility of the organisms common to eelgrass beds, and have implications for both conservation and restoration, suggesting that even small patches can rapidly promote abundant and diverse faunal communities.},

abstract = {Management of fisheries around the world is challenged by fishing impacts on habitats, bycatch species, threatened and endangered species, and even associated ecological communities. One response to these other factors has been a call for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), which demands consideration of the above non-target interactions. A challenge with implementation of EBFM is the scale and range of issues to be considered, all of which cannot be addressed at the same level of detail as for target species, due to data or time constraints. We developed an approach to progress the EBFM mandate in Australia, using a new ecological risk assessment framework applied to fisheries, termed Ecological Risk Assessment for the Effects of Fishing (ERAEF). Novel features of this framework include its hierarchical structure and its precautionary approach to uncertainty. The amount of information required increases through the hierarchy, and allows application in data-limited situations. The ERAEF framework has been applied to over 30 fisheries in Australia and elsewhere. The efficiencies in application of the hierarchical approach are illustrated by the south-east otter trawl fishery, where following Level 1 assessment of all components, an initial set of 600 species and 158 habitats was reduced to a group of concern of 159 species and 46 habitats using the Level 2 analysis, with the number of species of concern further reduced to 25 following Level 3 analysis. As a result of the assessments in Australia, management actions have been enacted for a range of the high risk species. Overall, the ERAEF approach offers a realistic method to assess ecological risk in an EBFM context, and has applicability in a wide range of fisheries. The interactive and inclusive nature of the approach also has the advantage of bringing stakeholders, scientists and managers together to develop management solutions.},

abstract = {Aim To develop and test theory based on connectivity to identify optimal networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) that protect multiple species with a range of dispersal strategies. Location The eastern North Sea in the Atlantic Ocean. Methods Theory of finding optimal MPA network is based on eigenvalue perturbation theory applied to population connectivity. Previous theory is here extended to the persistence of multiple species by solving a maximization problem with constraints, which identifies an optimal consensus network of MPAs. The theory is applied to two test cases within a 120,000 km2 area in the North Sea where connectivity was estimated with a biophysical model. In a realistic case, the theory is applied to the protection of rocky-reef habitats, where the biophysical model is parameterized with realistic dispersal traits for key species. Theoretical predictions of optimal networks were validated with a simple metapopulation model. Persistence of optimal consensus MPA networks is compared to randomly selected networks as well as to the existing MPA network. Results Despite few overlapping MPA sites for the optimal networks based on single dispersal strategies, the consensus network for multiple dispersal strategies performed well for 3 of 4 contrasting strategies even without user-defined constraints. In the test with five realistic dispersal strategies, representing a community on threatened rocky reefs, the consensus network performed equally well compared to solutions for single species. Different dispersal strategies were also protected jointly across the MPA network (93{\%} of sites), in contrast to simulations of the existing MPA network (2{\%} of sites). Consensus networks based on connectivity were significantly more efficient compared to existing MPAs. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that the new theoretic framework can identify a consensus MPA network that protects a whole community containing species with multiple dispersal strategies.},

Increasing variation in key ecological processes can signal impending state shifts in ecosystems. In a rocky intertidal meta-ecosystem consisting of three distinct regions spread across 260 km of the Oregon coast, we show that annually cleared sites are characterized by communities that exhibit signs of increasing destabilization (loss of resilience) over the past decade despite persistent community states. In all cases, recovery rates slowed and became more variable over time. The conditions underlying these shifts appear to be external to the system, with thermal disruptions (e.g., marine heat waves, El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation) and shifts in ocean currents (e.g., upwelling) being the likely proximate drivers. Although this iconic ecosystem has long appeared resistant to stress, the evidence suggests that subtle destabilization has occurred over at least the last decade.},

For three small estuaries in the Southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, changes in eelgrass area coverage and shape index (over the period of 1932-2016) were assessed using historical aerial photographs and unoccupied aerial system (UAS) imagery. In addition, changes in eelgrass area and shape index were evaluated in relation to landscape-level coastal environmental indicators, namely shoreline activities and alterations and residential housing density. All three eelgrass meadows showed a deteriorating trend in eelgrass condition; on average, eelgrass area coverage decreased by 45.1{\%}, while meadow complexity as indicated by the shape index increased by 66.3{\%}. Shoreline activities (boats, docks, log booms, and armoring) and residential housing density increased markedly at all sites over the study period and were strongly correlated to eelgrass area coverage and shape index. Changes in these landscape-level indicators over this period corroborate the observed decline in eelgrass habitat condition, because they suggest an overall deterioration of coastal environmental health in the Salish Sea due to increased use of the coastal zone, as well as declines in water quality due to urbanization.},

Estimates of global seagrass spatial distribution differ greatly throughout the published literature, ranging from 177,000 to 600,000 km2 with models suggesting potential distribution an order of magnitude higher. The requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement by outlining National Determined Contributions (NDC's) to reduce emissions is placing an increased global focus on the spatial extent, loss and restoration of seagrass meadows. Now more than ever there is a need to provide a more accurate and consistent measure of the global spatial distribution of seagrass. There is also a need to be able to assess the global spread of other seagrass ecosystem services and in their extension, the values of these services. In this study, by rationalising and updating a range of existing datasets of seagrass distribution around the globe, we have estimated with Moderate to High confidence the global seagrass area to date as 160,387 km2, but possibly 266,562 km2 with lower confidence. We break this global estimate down to a national level with a detailed analysis of the current state of mapped distribution and estimates of seagrass area per country. Accurate estimates, however, are challenged by large areas remaining unmapped and inconsistent measures being used. Through the examination of current global maps, we are able to propose a pathway forward for improving mapping of this important resource.},

Coral reef fishes are predicted to be especially susceptible to end-of-century ocean acidification on the basis of several high-profile papers4,5 that have reported profound behavioural and sensory impairments—for example, complete attraction to the chemical cues of predators under conditions of ocean acidification. Here, we comprehensively and transparently show that—in contrast to previous studies—end-of-century ocean acidification levels have negligible effects on important behaviours of coral reef fishes, such as the avoidance of chemical cues from predators, fish activity levels and behavioural lateralization (left–right turning preference). Using data simulations, we additionally show that the large effect sizes and small within-group variances that have been reported in several previous studies are highly improbable. Together, our findings indicate that the reported effects of ocean acidification on the behaviour of coral reef fishes are not reproducible, suggesting that behavioural perturbations will not be a major consequence for coral reef fishes in high CO2 oceans.},

We combine larval dispersal simulations from the Florida Keys with theoretical results to calculate the effect of fluctuations on bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus). We find that fluctuations depress growth only slightly (∼2{\%}), but the effect would be much stronger for an organism that spawned only part of the year. Larval behavior can also matter, as vertical migration allows larvae to become entrained in eddies. Eddies synchronize connectivity fluctuations, further decreasing growth. However, here, they also divide the Keys into largely independently fluctuating regions, mitigating the effects of local synchrony. Therefore, in situations where connectivity fluctuations matter, the presence of independently fluctuating regions due to larval behavior may be important.},

abstract = {A fully four-dimensional (3D×time) object-oriented biophysical dispersal model was developed to simulate the movement of marine larvae over semi-continuous surfaces. The model is capable of handling massive numbers of simulated larvae, can accommodate diverse life history patterns and distributions of characteristics, and saves point-level information to a relational database management system. The model was used to study Australia's northwest marine region, with attention given to connectivity patterns among Australia's north-western Commonwealth Marine Reserves (CMRs). Animations of larval movement near the Gascoyne canyon CMR, dispersal surfaces over depth and time for CMRs and Key Ecological Features in the northwest, as well as matrices of connectivity values among CMRs are shown. The matrices are further analysed to identify the sensitivity and elasticity of their values. The results generated by this model can aid in designing and managing marine protected area networks that incorporate extensive and complex benthic terrain (including the identification of marine 'corridors'), and for developing targeted field sampling strategies.},

abstract = {Continental boundary currents are projected to be altered under future scenarios of climate change. As these currents often influence dispersal and connectivity among populations of many marine organisms, changes to boundary cur- rents may have dramatic implications for population persistence. Networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) often aim to maintain connectivity, but anticipation of the scale and extent of climatic impacts on connectivity are required to achieve this critical conservation goal in a future of climate change. For two key marine species (kelp and sea urch- ins), we use oceanographic modelling to predict how continental boundary currents are likely to change connectivity among a network of MPAs spanning over 1000 km of coastline off the coast of eastern Australia. Overall change in predicted connectivity among pairs of MPAs within the network did not change significantly over and above tempo- ral variation within climatic scenarios, highlighting the need for future studies to incorporate temporal variation in dispersal to robustly anticipate likely change. However, the intricacies of connectivity between different pairs of MPAs were noteworthy. For kelp, poleward connectivity among pairs of MPAs tended to increase in the future, whereas equatorward connectivity tended to decrease. In contrast, for sea urchins, connectivity among pairs of MPAs generally decreased in both directions. Self-seeding within higher-latitude MPAs tended to increase, and the role of low-latitude MPAs as a sink for urchins changed significantly in contrasting ways. These projected changes have the potential to alter important genetic parameters with implications for adaptation and ecosystem vulnerability to cli- mate change. Considering such changes, in the context of managing and designing MPA networks, may ensure that conservation goals are achieved into the future.},

Despite the widespread application of SCP approaches, there is lim-ited understanding of the types of impacts resulting from related projects, and when and where it is most effective. This is compounded by the absence of a standardized approach to evaluating and reporting on the outcomes of SCP projects. We highlight the challenges of undertaking evaluations of complex planning processes, the current state of knowledge about the out-comes of SCP projects, and emerging opportunities to improve evaluation.

abstract = {Hydrodynamic Ocean Circulation Models and Lagrangian particle tracking models are valuable tools e.g. in coastal ecology to identify the connectivity between offshore spawning and coastal nursery areas of commercially important fish, for risk assessment and more for defining or evaluating marine protected areas. Most studies are based on only one model and do not provide levels of uncertainty. Here this uncertainty was addressed by applying a suite of 11 North Sea models to test what variability can be expected concerning connectivity. Different notional test cases were calculated related to three important and well-studied North Sea fish species: herring (Clupea harengus), and the flatfishes sole (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). For sole and plaice we determined which fraction of particles released in the respective spawning areas would reach a coastal marine protected area. For herring we determined the fraction located in a wind park after a predefined time span. As temperature is more and more a focus especially in biological and global change studies, furthermore inter-model variability in temperatures experienced by the virtual particles was determined. The main focus was on the transport variability originating from the physical models and thus biological behavior was not included. Depending on the scenario, median experienced temperatures differed by 3 °C between years. The range between the different models in one year was comparable to this temperature range observed between modelled years. Connectivity between flatfish spawning areas and the coastal protected area was highly dependent on the release location and spawning time. No particles released in the English Channel in the sole scenario reached the protected area while up to 20{\%} of the particles released in the plaice scenario did. Interannual trends in transport directions and connectivity rates were comparable between models but absolute values displayed high variations. Most models showed systematic biases during all years in comparison to the ensemble median, indicating that in general interannual variation was represented but absolute values varied. In conclusion: variability between models is generally high and management decisions or scientific analysis using absolute values from only one single model might be biased and results or conclusions drawn from such studies need to be treated with caution. We further concluded that more true validation data for particle modelling are required.},

abstract = {The structure of local ecological communities is thought to be determined by a series of hierarchical abiotic and biotic filters which select for or against species based on their traits. Many human impacts, like fragmentation, serve to alter environmental conditions across a range of spatial scales and may impact trait–environment interactions. We examined the effects of environmental variation associated with habitat fragmentation of seagrass habitat measured from microhabitat to landscape scales in controlling the taxonomic and trait-based community structure of benthic fauna. We measured patterns in species abundance and biomass of seagrass epifauna and infauna sampled using sediment cores from 86 sites (across 21 meadows) in Back Sound, North Carolina, USA. We related local faunal community structure to environmental variation measured at three spatial scales (microhabitat, patch and landscape). Additionally, we tested the value of species traits in predicting species-specific responses to habitat fragmentation across scales. While univariate measures of faunal communities (i.e. total density, biomass and species richness) were positively related to microhabitat-scale seagrass biomass only, overall community structure was predicted by environmental variation at the microhabitat, patch (i.e. patch size) and landscape (i.e. number of patches, landscape seagrass area) scales. Furthermore, fourth-corner analysis revealed that species traits explained as much variation in organismal densities as species identity. For example, species with planktonic-dispersing larvae and deposit-feeding trophic modes were more abundant in contiguous, high seagrass cover landscapes while suspension feeders favoured more fragmented landscapes. We present quantitative evidence supporting hierarchal models of community assembly which predict that interactions between species traits and environmental variation across scales ultimately drive local community composition. Variable responses of individual traits to multiple environmental variables suggest that community assembly processes that act on species via traits related to dispersal, mobility and trophic mode will be altered under habitat fragmentation. Additionally, with increasing global temperatures, the tropical seagrass Halodule wrightii is predicted to replace the temperate Zostera marina as the dominate seagrass in our study region, therefore potentially favouring species with planktonic-dispersing larva and weakening the strength of environmental control on community assembly.},

It helps understand the species-area relationship, a fundamental pattern in ecology and an essential tool for conservation. The classic TIB does not, however, account for the complex structure of ecological systems. We extend the TIB to take into account trophic interactions and derive a species-specific model for occurrence probability. We find that the properties of the regional food web influence the species-area relationship, and that, in return, immigration and extinction dynamics affect local food web properties. We compare the accuracy of the classic TIB to our trophic TIB to predict community composition of real food webs and find strong support for our trophic extension of the TIB. Our approach provides a parsimonious explanation to species distributions and open new perspectives to integrate the complexity of ecological interactions into simple species distribution models.},

abstract = {Based on the belief that marine larvae, which can spend days to months in the planktonic stage, could be transported considerable distances by ocean currents, it has long been assumed that populations of coastal species with a planktonic larval stage are demographically open and highly "connected." Such assumptions about the connectivity of coastal populations govern approaches to managing marine resources and shape our fundamental understanding of population dynamics and evolution, yet are rarely tested directly due to the small size and high mortality of marine larvae in a physically complex environment. Here, we document a successful application of elemental fingerprinting as a tracking tool to determine sources of settled invertebrates and show that coastal mussel larvae, previously thought to be highly dispersed, can be retained within 20-30 km of their natal origin. We compare two closely related and co-occurring species, Mytilus californianus and Mytilus galloprovincialis, and determine that, despite expected similarities, they exhibit substantially different connectivity patterns. Our use of an in situ larval culturing technique overcomes the previous challenge of applying microchemical tracking methods to species with completely planktonic development. The exchange of larvae and resulting connectivities among marine populations have fundamental consequences for the evolution and ecology of species and for the management of coastal resources.},

We identified most representative Natura 2000 sites that may increase the transfer of information within the national network of protected areas, detected clusters of sites and key sites for maintaining network cohesiveness, and highlighted the subsample of sites that retain the characteristics of the entire network.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are effective conservation and fisheries management tools that can also have a broad array of positive and negative social, economic, cultural, and political impacts on local communities. Drawing on results from a mixed-methods study of communities on the Andaman Coast of Thailand, this paper explores perceptions of MPA impacts on community livelihood resources (assets) and outcomes as well as MPA governance and management. The area includes 17 National Marine Parks (NMPs) that are situated near rural communities that are highly dependent on coastal resources. Interview participants perceived NMPs to have limited to negative impacts on fisheries and agricultural livelihoods and negligible benefits for tourism livelihoods. Perceived impacts on livelihoods were felt to result from NMPs undermining access to or lacking support for development of cultural, social, political, financial, natural, human, physical, and political capital assets. Conflicting views emerged on whether NMPs resulted in negative or positive marine or terrestrial conservation outcomes. Perceptions of NMP governance and management processes were generally negative. These results point to some necessary policy improvements and actions to ameliorate: the relationship between the NMP and communities, NMP management and governance processes, and socio-economic and conservation outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

It accurately reproduces nitrate concentrations with Willmott skill scores, root-mean-square error, and bias ranging from 0.84–0.95, 4.02–6.5 $\mu$M, and −2.33–1.84 $\mu$M, respectively, compared to three independent discrete sample data sets. A prominent feature of the model output is a tidal jet emanating from Discovery Passage producing a downstream plume of elevated surface nitrate. The signal is present from April to September, when surface nitrate is otherwise drawn down. It has a weak but statistically significant correlation to Discovery Passage tidal velocity (R=0.37, p{\textless}0.01). Within the turbulent jet and associated plume, the average rate of vertical nitrate supply due to mixing and advection across a depth of roughly 6 m is 0.46 $\mu$mol m−2 s−1 between 15 May and 20 August 2015, compared to 0.10 $\mu$mol m−2 s−1 for the northern Strait of Georgia as a whole. Close to Discovery Passage, where velocities and shear are strongest, the majority of the vertical nitrate flux is due to mixing. As velocities weaken downstream, vertical advection becomes more important relative to mixing, but vertical velocities also decrease. The tidal pulses out of Discovery Passage drive waves that contribute net upward nitrate flux as far south as Cape Lazo, 40 km away. The nitrate supply drives new production, consistent with existing observations. Similar dynamics have been described in many other tidally influenced coastal systems.},

Demand for leisure needs, already strong, will continue to increase. One segment of the market, outdoor nature-based recreation (including tourism), is growing strongly worldwide. A substantial proportion of these activities are water-based. The associated demand for recreational vessels has increased rapidly in recent years and is projected to continue to trend upwards. Australian trends mirror those internationally. Using Australia as a case study, we review the direct physical, chemical and biotic impacts associated with recreational boating in coastal water environments. Major physical impacts include disturbance due to movement of craft in shallow waters (e. g., turbulence) and the effects of anchoring/drag, noise/interference/collision that impacts on wildlife. The most critical chemical impacts result from pollution due to fuels and oils, defouling treatments (even those not legislated in-country), and human waste (e. g., sewage effluent). Important biotic impacts are the potential continued introduction and secondary spread of non-native species. We conclude that while greater research effort will provide more environmentally benign products, with the increasing popularity of recreation vessels, it will be beyond the resources of Australian governments to police legislation effectively. However, based on Australian's demonstrated engagement with government in terrestrial environmental management, with their deliberate engagement with the boating fraternity, the impacts of recreational boating would be lessened. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

We use numerical modelling to predict seagrass propagule dispersal and settlement to provide an approach for circumstances where direct, or even indirect, measures of population dynamics are difficult to establish. Location: Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Methods: We used the finite-element Second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model (SLIM) to resolve the hydrodynamics of the central Great Barrier Reef and to simulate the dispersal of seagrass. We predicted dispersal and settlement patterns by releasing 10.6 million passive particles representing seagrass propagules at known sites of seagrass presence. We considered two fractions when modelling seagrass dispersal: floating and suspended propagules. Both fractions were modelled using 34 simulations run for a maximum of 8 weeks during the peak seagrass reproductive period, capturing variability in winds, tides and currents. Results: The ‘virtual' seagrass propagules moved on average between 30 and 60 km, but distances of over 900 km also occurred. Most particle movement was to the north-west. The season (month) of release and source locations of the particles correlated with their dispersal distance, particularly for particles released offshore, with the complex coastal topography impeding movements close to the coast. The replenishment and recovery potential of the northernmost meadows was influenced by southern meadows. Protected north-facing bays were less likely to receive particles. Main conclusions: Our approach advances the conservation and management of marine biodiversity by predicting a key component of ecosystem resilience at a spatial scale that informs marine planning. We show a complex interaction among time, wind, water movement and topography that can guide a management response to improving replenishment and recovery after disturbance events.},

abstract = {Consumer and predator foraging behavior can impart profound trait-mediated constraints on community regulation that scale up to influence the structure and stability of ecosystems. Here, we demonstrate how the behavioral response of an apex predator to changes in prey behavior and condition can dramatically alter the role and relative contribution of top-down forcing, depending on the spatial organization of ecosystem states. In 2014, a rapid and dramatic decline in the abundance of a mesopredator (Pycnopodia helianthoides) and primary producer (Macrocystis pyrifera) coincided with a fundamental change in purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) foraging behavior and condition, resulting in a spatial mosaic of kelp forests interspersed with patches of sea urchin barrens. We show that this mosaic of adjacent alternative ecosystem states led to an increase in the number of sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) specializing on urchin prey, a populationlevel increase in urchin consumption, and an increase in sea otter survivorship. We further show that the spatial distribution of sea otter foraging efforts for urchin prey was not directly linked to high prey density but rather was predicted by the distribution of energetically profitable prey. Therefore, we infer that spatially explicit sea otter foraging enhances the resistance of remnant forests to overgrazing but does not directly contribute to the resilience (recovery) of forests. These results highlight the role of consumer and predator trait-mediated responses to resource mosaics that are common throughout natural ecosystems and enhance understanding of reciprocal feedbacks between top-down and bottomup forcing on the regional stability of ecosystems.},

abstract = {abstract: An impediment to understanding the origin and dynam-ics of the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG)—the most pervasive large-scale biotic pattern on Earth—has been the tendency to focus narrowly on a single causal factor when a more synthetic, integrative approach is needed. Using marine bivalves as a model system and drawing on other systems where possible, we review paleobiologic and biogeographic support for two supposedly opposing views, that the LDG is shaped primarily by (a) local environmental factors that determine the number of species and higher taxa at a given latitude (in situ hypotheses) or (b) the entry of lineages arising elsewhere into a focal region (spatial dynamics hypotheses). Support for in situ hypotheses includes the fit of present-day diversity trends in many clades to such environmental factors as temperature and the correla-tion of extinction intensities in Pliocene bivalve faunas with net re-gional temperature changes. Support for spatial dynamics hypoth-eses includes the age-frequency distribution of bivalve genera across latitudes, which is consistent with an out-of-the-tropics dynamic, as are the higher species diversities in temperate southeastern Australia and southeastern Japan than in the tropical Caribbean. Thus, both in situ and spatial dynamics processes must shape the bivalve LDG and are likely to operate in other groups as well. The relative strengths of the two processes may differ among groups showing similar LDGs, but dissecting their effects will require improved methods of integrat-ing fossil data with molecular phylogenies. We highlight several po-tential research directions and argue that many of the most dramatic biotic patterns, past and present, are likely to have been generated by diverse, mutually reinforcing drivers.},

We found that depth, near-bottom orbital velocities and a spectral pattern of Landsat imagery were relevant environmental variables, although there was no effect of slope or water residence time. We generated a data inventory of P.oceanica samples at Palma Bay, NW Mediterranean, from three main sources: side scan sonar, aerial imagery and a customized drop-camera system. A hierarchical Bayesian spatial model for non-Gaussian data was used to relate presence-absence data of P.oceanica with environmental variables in the presence of spatial autocorrelation (SA). A spatial dimension reduction method, the predictive process approach, was implemented to overcome computational constraints for moderately large datasets. Our results suggest that incorporating spatial random effects removes SA from the residuals and improves model fit compared to non-spatial regression models.

Using standardized assays that span 105° of latitude on four continents, we show that rates of bait consumption by generalist predators in shallow marine ecosystems are tightly linked to both temperature and the composition of consumer assemblages. Unexpectedly, rates of consumption peaked at midlatitudes (25 to 35°) in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres across both seagrass and unvegetated sediment habitats. This pattern contrasts with terrestrial systems, where biotic interactions reportedly weaken away from the equator, but it parallels an emerging pattern of a subtropical peak in marine biodiversity. The higher consumption at midlatitudes was closely related to the type of consumers present, which explained rates of consumption better than consumer density, biomass, species diversity, or habitat. Indeed, the apparent effect of temperature on consumption was mostly driven by temperature-associated turnover in consumer community composition. Our findings reinforce the key influence of climate warming on altered species composition and highlight its implications for the functioning of Earth's ecosystems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Landscape ecology has a high potential to contribute to sustainability in the interactions of people and nature. Landscape ecologists have already made considerable progress towards a more general understanding of the relevance of spatial variation for ecosystems. Incorporating the complexities of societies and economies into landscape ecology analyses will, however, require a broader framework for thinking about spatial elements of complexity. An exciting recent development is to explicitly try to integrate landscape ecology and ideas about resilience in social-ecological systems through the concept of spatial resilience. Spatial resilience focuses on the importance of location, connectivity, and context for resilience, based on the idea that spatial variation in patterns and processes at different scales both impacts and is impacted by local system resilience. I first introduce and define the concepts of resilience and spatial resilience and then discuss some of their potential contributions to the further interdisciplinary integration of landscape ecology, complexity theory, and sustainability science. Complexity theorists have argued that many complex phenomena, such as symmetry-breaking and selection, share common underlying mechanisms regardless of system type (physical, social, ecological, or economic). Similarities in the consequences of social exclusion and habitat fragmentation provide an informative example. There are many strong parallels between pattern-process interactions in social and ecological systems, respectively, and a number of general spatial principles and mechanisms are emerging that have relevance across many different kinds of system. Landscape ecologists, with their background in spatially explicit pattern-process analysis, are well placed to contribute to this emerging research agenda.},

abstract = {Technological advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models for ecology, with the potential now to specify a statistical model for abundances jointly across many taxa, to simultaneously explore interactions across taxa and the response of abundance to environmental variables. Joint models can be used for several purposes of interest to ecologists, including estimating patterns of residual correlation across taxa, ordination, multivariate inference about environmental effects and environment-by-trait interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving predictions in situations where one can leverage knowledge of some species to predict others. We demonstrate this by example and discuss recent computation tools and future directions. Many ecological questions require the joint analysis of abundances collected simultaneously across many taxonomic groups, and, if organisms are identified using modern tools such as metabarcoding, their number can be in the thousands.While historically such data have been analyzed using ad hoc algorithms, it is now possible to fully specify joint statistical models for abundance using multivariate extensions of generalized linear mixed models.These modern 'joint modeling' approaches allow the study of correlation patterns across taxa, at the same time as studying environmental response, to tease the two apart.Latent variable models are an especially exciting tool that has recently been used for ordination as well as for studying the factors driving co-occurrence.},

The Campeche Bank (CB) in the southern Gulf of Mexico flanks the strong-flowing Loop Current and is important ecologically and economically in the context of mesoscale connectivity to the Gulf. Here we use a biophysical model to examine connectivity between the CB and the northeastern Gulf (NEGOM) of simulated populations of lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles), red grouper (Epinephelus morio), and a generic marine organism. Our purpose was to assess longitudinal connectivity across the CB to the NEGOM and also to quantify this connectivity over a range of PLDs and organism fecundities. From this work, we find that portions of the northeastern perimeter of the CB in water depths between 50 and 300 m are the majority sources of lionfish and red grouper recruits to the NEGOM. This finding is important as deep waters on the bank are often heavily targeted by commercial fishers and are also beyond the reach of present lionfish control regimes. We also demonstrate that buoyant larvae must remain in the water column for a minimum of ten days to reach the NEGOM from the CB given prevailing water flow, though 45--50 days provides maximum connectivity. These findings are relevant for invasive species control, fisheries management, ecosystem services, and preserving metapopulations of marine fauna sympatric to the both regions.},

abstract = {Form–function relationships in plants underlie their ecosystem roles in supporting higher trophic levels through primary production, detrital pathways, and habitat provision. For widespread, phenotypically-variable plants, productivity may differ not only across abiotic conditions, but also from distinct morphological or demographic traits. A single foundation species, eelgrass Zostera marina, typically dominates north temperate seagrass meadows, which we studied across 14 sites spanning 32–61°N latitude and two ocean basins. Body size varied by nearly two orders of magnitude through this range, and was largest at mid-latitudes and in the Pacific Ocean. At the global scale, neither latitude, site-level environmental conditions, nor body size helped predict productivity (relative growth rate 1–2{\%} day-1 at most sites), suggesting a remarkable capacity of Z. marina to achieve similar productivity in summer. Furthermore, among a suite of stressors applied within sites, only ambient leaf damage reduced productivity; grazer reduction and nutrient addition had no effect on eelgrass size or growth. Scale-dependence was evident in different allometric relationships within and across sites for productivity and for modules (leaf count) relative to size. Zostera marina provides a range of ecosystem functions related to both body size (habitat provision, water flow) and growth rates (food, carbon dynamics). Our observed decoupling of body size and maximum production suggests that geographic variation in these ecosystem functions may be independent, with a future need to resolve how local adaptation or plasticity of body size might actually enable more consistent peak productivity across disparate environmental conditions.},

Advances in larval tagging and genetics have enhanced our capacity to track larval dispersal, assess scales of population connectivity, and quantify larval exchange among no-take marine reserves and fished areas. Recent studies have found that reserves can be a significant source of recruits for populations up to 40 km away, but the scale and direction of larval connectivity across larger seascapes remain unknown. Here, we apply genetic parentage analysis to investigate larval dispersal patterns for two exploited coral reef groupers (Plectropomus maculatus and Plectropomus leopardus) within and among three clusters of reefs separated by 60–220 km within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. A total of 69 juvenile P. maculatus and 17 juvenile P. leopardus (representing 6{\%} and 9{\%} of the total juveniles sampled, respectively) were genetically assigned to parent individuals on reefs within the study area. We identified both short-distance larval dispersal within regions (200 m to 50 km) and long-distance, multidirectional dispersal of up to {$\backslash$textasciitilde}250 km among regions. Dispersal strength declined significantly with distance, with best-fit dispersal kernels estimating median dispersal distances of {$\backslash$textasciitilde}110 km for P. maculatus and {$\backslash$textasciitilde}190 km for P. leopardus. Larval exchange among reefs demonstrates that established reserves form a highly connected network and contribute larvae for the replenishment of fished reefs at multiple spatial scales. Our findings highlight the potential for long-distance dispersal in an important group of reef fishes, and provide further evidence that effectively protected reserves can yield recruitment and sustainability benefits for exploited fish populations.},

Nevertheless, due to an increase of human activities and to climate change, in less than 20 years these ecosystems have lost one fifth of their global surface area. In response to this decrease, mangrove reforestation incentives have spread throughout the world. The scientific and societal legitimacy of reforestation actions still remain in question. Focusing on two case studies, the Saloum Delta and Lower Casamance, Senegal, our methodology was mainly based on the analysis of environmental narratives and discourses between 2009 and 2013, and on reforestation campaigns conducted by NGOs. We highlight the complexity of the system of values associated with the mangroves, as well as the positive and negative interactions between the services. Even although the reforestation campaigns were generally successful in terms of reforested surfaces and international visibility, they were poor in terms of biological and cultural diversities and led to spatial injustice. Moreover, the extensive reforestation with a unique mangrove species, Rhizophora mangle, was perceived as means of ‘green grabbing', and the simultaneous buying of carbon tax by industrial conglomerates induced disempowerment of the local communities.

abstract = {Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef (GBR) continues to suffer from repeated impacts of cyclones, coral bleaching, and outbreaks of the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), losing much of its coral cover in the process. This raises the question of the ecosystem's systemic resilience and its ability to rebound after large-scale population loss. Here, we reveal that around 100 reefs of the GBR, or around 3{\%}, have the ideal properties to facilitate recovery of disturbed areas, thereby imparting a level of systemic resilience and aiding its continued recovery. These reefs (1) are highly connected by ocean currents to the wider reef network, (2) have a relatively low risk of exposure to disturbances so that they are likely to provide replenishment when other reefs are depleted, and (3) have an ability to promote recovery of desirable species but are unlikely to either experience or spread COTS outbreaks. The great replenishment potential of these ‘robust source reefs', which may supply 47{\%} of the ecosystem in a single dispersal event, emerges from the interaction between oceanographic conditions and geographic location, a process that is likely to be repeated in other reef systems. Such natural resilience of reef systems will become increasingly important as the frequency of disturbances accelerates under climate change.},

abstract = {Marine reserves hold promise for maintaining biodiversity and sustainable fishery management, but studies supporting them have not addressed a crucial aspect of sustainability: the reduction in viability of populations with planktonic larvae dispersing along a coastal habitat with noncontiguous marine reserves. We show how sustainability depends on the fraction of natural larval settlement (FNLS) remaining after reserves are implemented, which in turn depends on reserve configuration and larval dispersal distance. Sustainability requires FNLS to be greater than an empirically determined minimum. Maintaining an adequate value for all species requires either a large, unlikely fraction ({\textgreater} 35{\%}) of coastline in reserves, or reserves that are larger than the mean larval dispersal distance of the target species. FNLS is greater for species dispersing shorter distances, which implies reserves can lead to: (1) changes in community composition and (2) genetic selection for shorter dispersal distance. Dependence of sustainability on dispersal distance is a new source of uncertainty.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Methods in Ecology and Evolution {\textcopyright} 2017 British Ecological Society Landscape heterogeneity and habitat connectivity affect species movements, playing an important role in determining the likelihood of species persistence. However, landscape connectivity is usually evaluated using static snap-shots, which do not account for the sequential interactions among habitat patches through time. We developed a network-based model of landscape dynamics, and corresponding connectivity metrics, to account for the reachable habitat across space and time. We illustrate the behaviour of these metrics, using fragmented forested landscapes in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We parametrized the models using the dispersal capacities of selected bird and small mammal species. We found that when considering spatio-temporal links, connectivity is estimated to be on average 30{\%} higher (with a maximum of 150{\%} higher) than what is estimated from purely spatial models. This higher degree of spatio-temporal connectivity arises due to connections through temporal stepping-stone patches that appear (habitat gain) and disappear (habitat loss) over time. Species with short dispersal distances ( {\textless} 1000 m) particularly benefited from the spatio-temporal connections. The contribution of spatio-temporal connectivity to habitat reachability increased with higher habitat loss rates. Moreover, it depended on the amount of habitat in the landscape, being higher at intermediate habitat amounts (∼30{\%}). We showed that accounting for spatio-temporal connectivity is critical for understanding ecological patterns and processes in dynamic landscapes, and that a series of purely spatial connectivity metrics underestimates the actual connectivity patterns across time. The proposed spatio-temporal connectivity approach and metrics can be applied to evaluate the effective connectivity patterns and trends in a variety of dynamic landscapes, avoiding the potential overestimates of population isolation and extinction probabilities that may result from widely used purely spatial connectivity models.},

However, little is known about the fate and transport of eDNA in the ocean, thus limiting the ability to interpret eDNA measurements. In the present study, we explore how fate and transport processes affect oceanic eDNA in Monterey Bay, California, USA (MB). Regional ocean modeling predictions of advection and mixing are used for an approximately 10,000 km2 area in and around MB to simulate the transport of eDNA. These predictions along with realistic settling rates and first-order decay rate constants are applied as inputs into a particle tracking model to investigate the displacement and spread of eDNA from its release location. We found that eDNA can be transported on the order of tens of kilometers in a few days and that horizontal advection, decay, and settling have greater impacts on the displacement of eDNA in the ocean than mixing. The eDNA particle tracking model was applied to identify possible origin locations of eDNA measured in MB using a quantitative PCR assay for Northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). We found that eDNA likely originated from within 40 km and south of the sampling site if it had been shed approximately 4 days prior to sampling.},

This proposition first envisioned by Forbes (1907) and then Diamond (1975) prompted the development of numerous modelling approaches (e.g. null model analysis, co-occurrence networks and, more recently, joint species distribution models). Both theory and experimental evidence support the idea that ecological interactions may affect co-occurrence, but it remains unclear to what extent the signal of interaction can be captured in observational data. It is now time to step back from the statistical developments and critically assess whether co-occurrence data are really a proxy for ecological interactions. In this paper, we present a series of arguments based on probability, sampling, food web and coexistence theories supporting that significant spatial associations between species (or lack thereof) is a poor proxy for ecological interactions. We discuss appropriate interpretations of co-occurrence, along with potential avenues to extract as much information as possible from such data.},

By filtering the water column of pathogens, seagrasses reduce contamination in seafood while also reducing coral disease (2). Given the global distribution of seagrass and its role in climate mitigation and food security, the protection of these ecosystems has implications for the planetary boundaries within which humanity can safely operate (3, 4).

A pilot ecological risk assessment for the Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA) was conducted to test the effectiveness of an ecological risk assessment framework developed by O et al. (2015). During the scoping phase, a subset of 17 significant ecological components (SECs) was chosen to represent major functional groups in PNCIMA based on their data availability. Marine, land-based and global activities currently occurring within the area and their associated stressors were identified using an interaction matrix with accompanying evidence tables because Pathways of Effects models were under development and therefore unavailable. A subset of stressors was evaluated (76 in total) for the identified activities. Risk was evaluated using four variables: Spatial scale, Temporal scale, Load, and Consequence. Scoring was based on literature review and an uncertainty score assigned for each variable taking into consideration data availability, quality and scientific consensus. Risk scores for each stressor-SEC combination were calculated using one of two methods: 1. Binned exposure using the methods as outlined by O et al. (2015); and 2. Uncertainty incorporation using Monte Carlo simulation to directly incorporate the uncertainty scores in the risk calculation. Cumulative risk for each SEC was calculated by summing the risk scores for each SEC. Using the uncertainty incorporation method, the SECs with the highest cumulative risk were Dungeness Crab, Salmon, Sponges, and Seagrasses. The highest ranking stressors across all SECs were trawling-related and most of the highest ranked stressors for each SEC were trawl- related. The relative ranking of risk was similar between the two risk calculation methods but the Uncertainty Incorporation showed where uncertainty was highest between exposure and consequence, and could be used to prioritize research and focus management efforts. The Qualitative Level One ecological risk assessment was found to be an effective triage tool, providing a relative ranking of SECs and stressors. However, the current pilot project is not a complete risk assessment for PNCIMA because it is based on a subset of SECs and stressors affecting PNCIMA and the resulting scores have not been vetted by experts. Therefore the results should not be used for policy or management decisions at this stage},

abstract = {Pelagic organisms' movement and motion of buoyant particles are driven by processes operating across multiple, spatial and temporal scales. We developed a probabilistic, multi-scale model, the Connectivity Modeling System (CMS), to gain a mechanistic understanding of dispersion and migration processes in the ocean. The model couples offline a new nested-grid technique to a stochastic Lagrangian framework where individual variability is introduced by drawing particles' attributes at random from specified probability distributions of traits. This allows 1) to track seamlessly a large number of both actively swimming and inertial particles over multiple, independent ocean model domains and 2) to generate ensemble forecasts or hindcasts of the particles' three dimensional trajectories, dispersal kernels, and transition probability matrices used for connectivity estimates. In addition, CMS provides Lagrangian descriptions of oceanic phenomena (advection, dispersion, retention) and can be used in a broad range of oceanographic applications, from the fate of pollutants to the pathways of water masses in the global ocean. Here we describe the CMS modular system where particle behavior can be augmented with specific features, and a parallel module implementation simplifies data management and CPU intensive computations associated with solving for the tracking of millions of active particles. Some novel features include on-the-fly data access of operational hydrodynamic models, individual particle variability and inertial motion, and multi-nesting capabilities to optimize resolution. We demonstrate the performance of the interpolation algorithm by testing accuracy in tracing the flow stream lines in both time and space and the efficacy of probabilistic modeling in evaluating the bio-physical coupling against empirical data. Finally, following recommended practices for the development of community models, we provide an open source code with a series of coupled standalone, optional modules detailed in a user's guide. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Dispersal is a key process in metacommunity dynamics, allowing the maintenance of diversity in complex community networks. Geographic distance is usually used as a surrogate for connectivity implying that communities that are closely located are considered more prone to exchange individuals than distant communities. However, in some natural systems, organisms may be subjected to directional dispersal (air or water flows, particular landscape configuration), possibly leading close communities to be isolated from each other and distant communities to be connected. Using geographic distance as a proxy for realised connectivity may then yield misleading results regarding the role of dispersal in structuring communities in such systems. Here, we quantified the relative importance of flow connectivity, geographic distance, and environmental gradients to explain polychaete metacommunity structure along the coasts of the Gulf of Lions (northwest Mediterranean Sea). Flow connectivity was estimated by Lagrangian particle dispersal simulations. Our results revealed that this metacommunity is strongly structured by the environment at large spatial scales, and that both flow connectivity and geographic distance play an important role within homogeneous environments at smaller spatial scales. We thus strongly advocate for a wider use of connectivity measures, in addition to geographic distance, to study spatial patterns of biological diversity (e.g. distance decay) and to infer the processes behind these patterns at different spatial scales.},

To achieve such predictions, ecology has extensively relied on the assumption that community states and dynamics are at equilibrium with climate. However, empirical evidence from Quaternary and contemporary data suggest that species communities rarely follow equilibrium dynamics with climate change. This discrepancy between the conceptual foundation of many predictive models and observed community dynamics casts doubts on our ability to successfully predict future community states. Here we used community response diagrams to empirically investigate the occurrence of different classes of disequilibrium responses in plant communities during the Late Quaternary, and bird communities during modern climate warming in North America. We documented a large variability in types of responses, suggesting that equilibrium dynamics are not the most common type of response to climate change. Bird responses appeared less predictable to modern climate warming than plant responses to Late Quaternary climate warming. Furthermore, we showed that baseline climate gradients were a strong predictor of disequilibrium states, while ecological factors such as species' traits had a substantial, but inconsistent effect on the deviation from equilibrium. We conclude that (1) complex temporal community dynamics including stochastic responses, lags, and alternate states are common; (2) assuming equilibrium dynamics to predict biodiversity responses to future climate changes may lead to unsuccessful predictions},

Connectivity is a fundamental aspect of MPA design and evaluation, but regional patterns of marine ecological connectivity are often not well understood, nor how connectivity patterns may be affected by climate change. Our objective was to assess how ecological connectivity between MPAs may shift with projected ocean temperature changes in the Northern Shelf Bioregion in British Columbia, Canada, and demonstrate a potential approach that can be used in other systems. We conducted a case study with Dungeness Crab (Metacarcinus magister) and Shortspine Thornyhead (Sebastolobus alascanus) using benthic temperature outputs from a regional ocean model for hindcast (1981–2010) and future (2041–2070) periods coupled with species' environmental preference information. We evaluated MPA exposure to projected temperature changes and suitability for the adult stage of the focal species. Using existing least-cost and circuit theory-based tools more often applied in terrestrial systems, we identified potential linkages between MPAs via adult movement, simulating both optimal and probabilistic paths, then compared MPA interconnectedness between time periods. There was a marked decrease in MPA suitability and interconnectedness for Shortspine Thornyhead under projected future climates, while there was a marked increase in MPA suitability for Dungeness Crab and minor increase in MPA interconnectedness. Given the contrasting results in connectivity changes when examining just two species, this study highlights the challenge of building climate resilience in MPA network designs with multispecies objectives.},

The components of a general theory of ecology have existed for the past half century; ecologists simply have failed to explicitly recognize them.We present a general theory of ecology and show how it relates to ecology's numerous constituent theories and models. The general theory consists of a description of the domain of ecology and a set of fundamental principles. The domain of ecology is the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution and abundance of organisms, including causes and consequences. Fundamental principles are broad statements about the patterns that exist and the processes that operate within a domain. The seven fundamental principles of the theory of ecology are: the heterogeneous distribution of organisms, interactions of organisms, contingency, envi- ronmental heterogeneity, finite and heterogeneous resources, the mortality of organisms, and the evolutionary cause of ecological properties. These principles are the necessary and sufficient elements for a general theory of ecology. The propositions of any constituent theory of ecology can be shown to be a consequence of these fundamental principles along with principles from other science domains. The general theory establishes relationships among constituent theories through shared fundamental principles. The next challenge is to develop and integrate unified, constituent theories and to establish the relationships among them within the framework established by the general theory.},

Strengthening management measures necessitate understanding the variability of larval connectivity and bridging global connectivity models to local scales. An individual-based Lagrangian biophysical model was used to simulate connectivity between coral reefs for three organisms with different early life history characteristics: a coral (Acropora millepora), a sea urchin (Tripneustes gratilla), and a reef fish (Epinephelus sp). Connectivity metrics and reef clusters were computed from the settlement probability matrices. Fitted power law functions derived from the dispersal kernels provided relative probabilities of connection given only the distance between reefs, and demonstrated that 95{\%} of the larvae across organisms settled within a third of their maximum settlement distances. The magnitude of the connectivity metric values of reef cells were sensitive to differences both in the type of organism and temporal variability. Seasonal variability of connections was more dominant than interannual variability. However, despite these differences, the moderate to high correlation of metrics between organisms and seasonal matrices suggest that the spatial patterns are relatively similar between reefs. A cluster analysis based on the Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity of sink and source connections synthesized the inherent variability of these multiple large connectivity matrices. Through this, similarities in regional connectivity patterns were determined at various cluster sizes depending on the scale of interest. The validity of the model is supported by 1) the simulated dispersal kernels being within the range of reported parentage analysis estimates; and, 2) the clusters that emerged reflect the dispersal barriers implied by previously published population genetics studies. The tools presented here (dispersal kernels, temporal variability maps and reef clustering) can be used to include regional patterns of connectivity into the spatial management of coral reefs.},

abstract = {There are two popular statistical models for meta-analysis, the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model. The fact that these two models employ similar sets of formulas to compute statistics, and sometimes yield similar estimates for the various parameters, may lead people to believe that the models are interchangeable. In fact, though, the models represent fundamentally different assumptions about the data. The selection of the appropriate model is important to ensure that the various statistics are estimated correctly. Additionally, and more fundamentally, the model serves to place the analysis in context. It provides a framework for the goals of the analysis as well as for the interpretation of the statistics.In this paper we explain the key assumptions of each model, and then outline the differences between the models. We conclude with a discussion of factors to consider when choosing between the two models. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Still, considerable gaps in our understanding of the spatial ecology of ecosystem services remain. We combined spatial information on larval dispersal networks and estimates of human pressure to test the importance of connectivity for ecosystem service provision. We found that reefs receiving larvae from highly connected dispersal corridors were associated with high fish species richness. Generally, larval “sinks” contained twice as much fish biomass as “sources” and exhibited greater resilience to human pressure when protected. Despite their potential to support biodiversity persistence and sustainable fisheries, up to 70{\%} of important dispersal corridors, sinks, and source reefs remain unprotected, emphasizing the need for increased protection of networks of well-connected reefs.},

Generalizations based on geographic proximity, taxonomy, or life history characteristics provide little predictive power in determining overall patterns of connectivity, and therefore offer little in terms of delineating boundaries for marine spatial management areas. Here, we provide a case study of 27 taxonomically and ecologically diverse species (including reef fishes, marine mammals, gastropods, echinoderms, cnidarians, crustaceans, and an elasmobranch) that reveal four concordant barriers to dispersal within the Hawaiian Archipelago which are not detected in single-species exemplar studies. We contend that this multispecies approach to determine concordant patterns of connectivity is an objective and logical way in which to define the minimum number of management units and that EBM in the Hawaiian Archipelago requires at least five spatially managed regions.},

abstract = {Estuaries are important mediators in the transport of freshwater, sediment, and dissolved material into the ocean, and many studies have investigated mean estuarine circulation. However, it is not clear how descriptions of the mean circulation are linked to the motion of individual water parcels, or of discrete items floating within the system, nor how they related to the variability in this dispersal. An obvious approach to characterizing this variability is to actually measure dispersal by tracking Lagrangian drifters. Recent technological advances have dramatically decreased the cost of satellite-tracked and monitored drifters, making longer deployments of large numbers of expendable drifters much more feasible. Here we take advantage of this opportunity to directly characterize the seaward flow and dispersion of surface water in a relatively well-studied estuarine system (the Salish Sea on the NE Pacific coast), combining 2200 drifter-days of data from more than 400 tracked drifters with the deployment of nearly 6000 traditional driftcards. Residence times in different parts of the system estimated from the drifter observations are similar but systematically lower than those derived from other methods, and we speculate that this may be because surface drifts are faster than layer-mean drifts in a fjord-type estuarine system. We also find that drifters tend to ground on shore, and that time to-grounding from different source locations has an approximately exponential distribution with a mean of only a few days, much less than the transport time to the ocean. The estuary is therefore a highly efficient trap for floating objects. Finally, we quantify a dispersion coefficient, finding that dispersion is a critical component of transport in parts of the Salish Sea, often much more important than mean advection. The mean is visible only after averaging for weeks or months.},

Flowering shoot density (peaking at 7.8 m-2) and total seed production (1094 million seeds yr-1) of this meadow was determined in the field and used as model input. Dispersal of floating generative shoots dislodged by increased water turbulence during autumn was modelled using a 3D transport model (Delft3D-WAQ). Transport of eelgrass seeds contained in floating reproductive shoots with the prevailing hydrodynamic regime revealed maximum dispersal distances of up to 130 km from the source of seed production. The effect of wind speed and direction on seed transport was assessed by applying a wind drag function (3{\%} of wind speed) on surface currents in the model using actual wind data from 10 consecutive years (1993 to 2002). Main transport direction under average autumn wind conditions was northeastward. Easterly winds (occurring at an average frequency of 15{\%}) were responsible for some westward transport of eelgrass seeds (at densities {\textgreater}0.2 seeds m-2) up to 20 km from the estuary. Westward eelgrass colonization of suitable areas in the Dutch Wadden Sea appears to be limited by seed supply due to transport limitations posed by the prevailing hydrodynamic regime. Extreme events, such as prolonged Eastern storms, might promote seed dispersal further westwards, allowing for natural recovery of eelgrass in this area; this theory is supported by observations of localized eelgrass patches up to 40 km west of the estuary. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

Here, we review empirical approaches to metacommunities, both observational and experimental, pertaining to how well they relate to and test theoretical metacommunity paradigms and how well they capture the realities of natural ecosystems. First, we show that the species-sorting and mass-effects paradigms are the most commonly tested and supported paradigms. Second, the dynamics observed can often be ascribed to two or more of the four non-exclusive paradigms. Third, empirical approaches relate only weakly to the concise assumptions and predictions made by the paradigms. Consequently, we suggest major avenues of improvement for empirical metacommunity approaches, including the integration across theoretical approaches and the incorporation of evolutionary and meta-ecosystem dynamics. We hope for metacommunity ecology to thereby bridge existing gaps between empirical and theoretical work, thus becoming a more powerful framework to understand dynamics across ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Maps of nearshore marine habitat are fundamental tools for the management and conservation of coastal ecosystems. While traditional field mapping techniques, such as towed video and diver surveys, are still commonly employed for generating highly detailed maps of seafloor habitat, acoustic and satellite remote sensing have proven to be efficient alternatives for generating habitat maps. To date remote sensing using satellite imagery has dominated mapping efforts over coral reefs and other tropical ecosystems with fewer studies applied in temperate marine regions where acoustic studies are more common. Few studies exist that have assessed the performance of high resolution satellite imagery in mapping seafloor habitat in temperate regions. This paper compares the efficacy of high resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) and a single-beam acoustic ground discrimination system (QTC View V) for mapping the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation at a site within the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area (GHNMCA) off the north coast of British Columbia, Canada. Ground-truth data for training and validation were collected using a towed underwater video camera. Prior to classification the WorldView-2 image (8 bands, 2. m resolution) was processed following orthorectification, atmospheric correction, glint correction, land and optically deep water masking. An acoustic survey was conducted using a 200. kHz echosounder and data were processed and interpolated using QTC IMPACT software. The WorldView-2 imagery performed best in mapping habitat in regions shallower than 3. m, obtaining a total accuracy 75{\%}, where it could identify the distribution of green algae (Ulva spp.), brown algae (Fucus spp.) and eelgrass (Zostera marina). The 200. kHz data were unable to detect the distribution of brown and green algae but were able to map the distribution of eelgrass as well as a subtidal red algae (Chondrocanthus exasperatus) (total accuracy 80{\%}). A final habitat map containing all habitat types present at the study site was produced using the output from both datasets. The study resulted in recommendations for remote mapping of submerged vegetation in temperate coastal area. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

It is difficult to inform the planning and management of marine ecosystems at that scale because of the high cost associated with collecting data. To address this and to inform the management of coastal (approximately 15 m below mean sea level) habitats at the scale of the GBR, this study determined the presence and distribution of seagrass by generating a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based habitat suitability model. 3.A Bayesian belief network was used to quantify the relationship (dependencies) between seagrass and eight environmental drivers: relative wave exposure, bathymetry, spatial extent of flood plumes, season, substrate, region, tidal range and sea surface temperature. The analysis showed at the scale of the entire coastal GBR that the main drivers of seagrass presence were tidal range and relative wave exposure. Outputs of the model include probabilistic GIS-surfaces of seagrass habitat suitability in two seasons and at a planning unit of cell size 2 km2 km. 4.The habitat suitability maps developed in this study extend along the entire GBR coast, and can inform the management of coastal seagrasses at an ecosystem scale. The predictive modelling approach addresses the problems associated with delineating habitats at the scale appropriate for the management of ecosystems and the cost of collecting field data.},

abstract = {Among the most enduring ecological challenges is an integrated theory explaining the latitudinal biodiversity gradient, including discrepancies observed at different spatial scales. Analysis of Reef Life Survey data for 4127 marine species at 2406 coral and rocky sites worldwide confirms that the total ecoregion richness peaks in low latitudes, near +15°N and −15°S. However, although richness at survey sites is maximal near the equator for vertebrates, it peaks at high latitudes for large mobile invertebrates. Site richness for different groups is dependent on abundance, which is in turn correlated with temperature for fishes and nutrients for macroinvertebrates. We suggest that temperature-mediated fish predation and herbivory have constrained mobile macroinvertebrate diversity at the site scale across the tropics. Conversely, at the ecoregion scale, richness responds positively to coral reef area, highlighting potentially huge global biodiversity losses with coral decline. Improved conservation outcomes require management frameworks, informed by hierarchical monitoring, that cover differing site- and regional-scale processes across diverse taxa, including attention to invertebrate species, which appear disproportionately threatened by warming seas.},

abstract = {The main goal of this thesis was to evaluate the use of high spatial remote imagery to map the location and biophysical parameters of eelgrass in marine areas around Sidney Spit, a part of the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve of Canada (GINPRC). To meet this goal, three objectives were addressed: (1) Define key spectral variables that provide optimum separation between eelgrass and its associated benthic substrates, using in situ hyperspectral measurements, and simulated IKONOS and Landsat 7ETM+ spectral response; (2) evaluate the efficacy of these key variables in classification of the high spatial resolution imagery, AISA and IKONOS, at various levels of processing, to determine the processing methodology that offers the highest eelgrass mapping accuracy; and (3) evaluate the potential of "value-added" classification of two eelgrass biophysical indicators, LAI and epiphyte type. In situ hyperspectral measurements acquired at Sidney Spit in August 2008 provided four different data sets: above water spectra, below water spectral profiles, water-corrected spectra, and pure endmember spectra. In Chapter 3, these data sets were examined with first derivative analysis to determine the unique spectral variables of eelgrass and associated benthic substrates. The most effective variables in discriminating eelgrass from all other substrates were selected using data reduction statistics: M-statistic analysis and multiple discriminant analyses (MDA). These selected spectral variables enabled eelgrass classification accuracy of 98{\%} when separating six classes on above water data: shallow ( 3 m) eelgrass, shallow sand, deep sand, shallow green algae, and spectrally deep water. The variables were located mainly in the green wavelengths, where light penetrates to the greatest depth: the slope from 500 - 530 nm, and the first derivatives at 566 nm, 580 nm, and 602 nm. The same data were classified with 96{\%} accuracy after correcting for the water column, using the ratios 566:600 and 566:710. The only source of confusion for all data sets was between green algae and eelgrass, presumably due to their similar pigment composition. IKONOS and Landsat 7ETM+ simulated datasets performed similarly well, with 92{\%} and 94{\%} eelgrass classification accuracy respectively. In Chapter 4, the efficacy of the selected features was tested in the classification of airborne hyperspectral AISA imagery and satellite platform multispectral IKONOS imagery, and compared with various other classifiers, both supervised and unsupervised: K-means, minimum distance (MD), linear spectral unmixing (LSU), and spectral angle mapper (SAM). The selected features achieved the highest eelgrass classification accuracies in the study, when combined with atmospheric correction, glint correction, and optically deep water masking. AISA achieved eelgrass producer and user accuracies of 85{\%} in water shallower than 3 m, and 93{\%} in deeper areas. IKONOS achieved 79{\%} for shallow waters and 82{\%} for deep waters. Endmember classification also showed accuracies over 84{\%} and 71{\%} in AISA and IKONOS imagery respectively. Again, the largest source of confusion was between eelgrass and green algae, as well as between exposed vegetation (sea asparagus and green algae) and exposed eelgrass. Incompatibilities of the automatable processing steps (Tafkaa, LSU and SAM) made automated mapping less accurate than supervised mapping, but suggestions are made toward improvement. The value-added classification of eelgrass LAI and epiphyte type produced poor results in all cases except one; epiphyte presence / absence could be delineated with 87{\%} accuracy. Before applying the findings of this study, one must consider the spatial scale of the intended management goal and select imagery with suitable spatial resolution. Tidal variations, as well as seasonal variability in water conditions and eelgrass phenology must also be considered as they may affect classification accuracies.},

abstract = {Coastal seascapes can support high animal diversity and secondary productivity that attracts conservation interest and provides ecosystem services. Though the importance of spatial structure in marine habitats is well known, determining the dominant spatial scale for biodiversity patterns is an often‐overlooked dimension of the ecological and conservation value of seagrass meadows. We estimated biodiversity patterns at fine (0.28 m2), meadow and seascape scales to explore whether seagrass‐associated biodiversity patterns are consistent with spatial processes such as abiotic habitat filtering or metacommunity dynamics in a northeast Pacific seascape. In Barkley Sound, British Columbia, we quantified epifaunal biodiversity on eelgrass (Zostera marina) to test three hypotheses: Taxonomic diversity and composition (1) vary randomly within meadows but (2) vary systematically among meadows reflecting meadow location or environmental conditions, and (3) spatial patterns are stable over time. We sampled epifaunal invertebrates in a systematic spatial grid within nine eelgrass meadows. We found that epifaunal community composition varied as much over a few meters within the same meadow as among meadows separated by kilometers and of different sizes and wave exposures. In each meadow, we observed less than three‐quarters of the species in the regional species pool, and we observed non‐random spatial aggregation within many species. Even with spatial turnover, assemblages were more similar than predicted by null models based on random species distributions, suggesting that some species tend to co‐occur in high abundance. These spatial biodiversity patterns were not clearly explained by meadow location, area, or abiotic conditions, except that there were differences in clusters of meadows distinguished by their salinity (more marine vs. more fresh). Our results indicate that effective conservation and understanding of how seagrass can support high biodiversity and ecosystem function may require consideration of spatial connections among meadows, and not just the condition of the meadows themselves.},

abstract = {This study investigates the sensitivity of a high resolution regional ocean model to several choices in mixing and advection. The oceanographic process examined is a deep water renewal event in the Juan de Fuca Strait–Strait of Georgia sill-basin estuarine system located on the west coast of North America. Previous observational work has shown that the timing of the renewal events is linked to the spring/neap tidal cycle, and in turn, is sensitive to the amount of vertical mixing induced by tidal currents interacting with sills and complicated bathymetry. It is found that the model's representation of deep water renewal is relatively insensitive to several mixing choices, including the vertical turbulence closure and direction of lateral mixing. No significant difference in deep or intermediate salinity was found between cases that used k−ϵ versus k−$\omega$ closures and isoneutral versus horizontal lateral mixing. Modifications that had a stronger effect included those that involved advection such as modifying the salinity of the open boundary conditions which supply the source waters for the renewal event. The strongest impact came from the removal of the Hollingsworth instability, a kinetic energy sink in the energy-enstrophy discretization of the momentum equations. A marked improvement to the salinity of the deep water renewal suggests that the removal of the Hollingsworth instability will correct a fresh drift in the deep and intermediate waters in an operational version of this model.},

abstract = {Marine reserves are a key tool for the conservation of marine biodiversity, yet only {\~{}}2.5{\%} of the world's oceans are protected. The integration of marine reserves into connected networks representing all habitats has been encouraged by international agreements, yet the benefits of this design has not been tested empirically. Australia has one of the largest systems of marine reserves, providing a rare opportunity to assess how connectivity influences conservation success. An Australia-wide dataset was collected using baited remote underwater video systems deployed across a depth range from 0 to 100 m to assess the effectiveness of marine reserves for protecting teleosts subject to commercial and recreational fishing. A meta-analytical comparison of 73 fished species within 91 marine reserves found that, on average, marine reserves had 28{\%} greater abundance and 53{\%} greater biomass of fished species compared to adjacent areas open to fishing. However, benefits of protection were not observed across all reserves (heterogeneity), so full subsets generalized additive modelling was used to consider factors that influence marine reserve effectiveness, including distance-based and ecological metrics of connectivity among reserves. Our results suggest that increased connectivity and depth improve the aforementioned marine reserve benefits and that these factors should be considered to optimize such benefits over time. We provide important guidance on factors to consider when implementing marine reserves for the purpose of increasing the abundance and size of fished species, given the expected increase in coverage globally. We show that marine reserves that are highly protected (no-take) and designed to optimize connectivity, size and depth range can provide an effective conservation strategy for fished species in temperate and tropical waters within an overarching marine biodiversity conservation framework.},

abstract = {In this study, variations of offshore wind speed in the northern and central coasts of British Columbia are examined using wind observations from nine buoys distributed in the region. Wind speeds from all buoys are extrapolated to the standard (10 m) wind measurement height as well as to the wind turbine hub height (100 m) using Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. Sustained winds above several thresholds are analysed and values of 50 and 100-year return extreme wind speed levels are calculated for all locations. The percentage of sustained winds between the wind turbine cut-in and cut-out wind speed thresholds at 100 m indicates short periods without power generation. The highest 50 and 100-year return level values are found at locations west of Haida Gwaii, while the lowest values are calculated at the most southern and eastern locations. Spatial coherency analysis of high wind speeds between all locations shows high same-day coherency ratios between all buoys located offshore of the mainland coast, which emphasizes the importance of the atmospheric circulation at the synoptic-scale as the main driver of intense wind events; consequently, a synoptic-scale circulation analysis is carried out by applying principal components analysis and k-means clustering, and then relating the calculated synoptic patterns to some of the previously classified wind categories. The synoptic-scale circulation analysis reveals that high wind speed events are mainly associated with a system of low pressure located west or northwest of the study region, which induces intense southerly to southeasterly winds. Low wind speeds are often associated with a high-pressure system (Pacific High) originating southwest of the region that mainly predominates during the summer.},

Secondly, by linking ecological models with models of other systems, such as economic and social models. Thirdly, by considering alternative approaches to generate and model data that use, for example, discrete or categorical states to model ecological systems. We particularly highlight that models are essential for making predictions.

abstract = {This paper is an assessment of the fish habitat significance of a particular ecotone of the marine and estuarine shoreline in British Columbia- locations where aquatic habitat at higher tides merges into terrestrial habitat. Scientific data on these supralittoral areas, frequently called the "marine riparian" by managers are scarce in Pacific region. Habitat and ocean managers are dealing with uncertainty when assessing these areas in relation to forestry, urban development, and other industrial activities. There is evidence showing that unvegetated beach substrate in the marine riparian is used as spawning and incubation habitat for sandlance and surf smelt. Marine riparian is also recognized as rearing and migratory habitat for juvenile salmonids. Preliminary studies conducted at two locations in the Strait of Georgia in February and March 2001 showed that a variety of arthropods are potentially available as fish food from intact marine riparian habitats. The functional importance of marine riparian is likely to be related to food production, temperature regulation, wave energy absorption, and provision of structure as well as indirect ecological value. As an interim measure, based on the sparse available literature, we recommend that a site specific approach be taken to buffer zone widths to manage the marine riparian. Gravel, sand, or cobble beaches may be most susceptible to erosion and sediment sloughing from land, depending on backshore conditions. We also advise a careful review of the rationale, efficacy, and performance of the setback distances proposed in Clayoquot Sound and Puget Sound. Several focused research projects are recommended.},

Surveys at multiple spatial scales across a 125 km range of Atlantic Canadian bays and estuaries demonstrated consistent declines in eelgrass biomass by as much as 79{\%} at commercial culture leases versus reference areas. Reductions in biomass were negatively related to both oyster stocking density and the age of culture leases. We further observed reductions in the capacity of eelgrass photochemistry at culture sites, accompanied by primary production declines of 37.9{\%}.

Larval behavior has been shown to influence dispersal, but how to incorporate behavior effectively within dispersal models remains a challenge. Mechanisms of behavior are often derived from laboratory-based studies and therefore, may not reflect behavior in situ. Here, using state-of-the-art models, we explore the movements that larvae must undertake to achieve the vertical distribution patterns observed in nature. Results suggest that behaviors are not consistent with those described under the tidally synchronized vertical migration (TVM) hypothesis. Instead, we show ( i ) a need for swimming speed and direction to vary over the tidal cycle and ( ii ) that, in some instances, larval swimming cannot explain observed vertical patterns. We argue that current methods of behavioral parameterization are limited in their capacity to replicate in situ observations of vertical distribution, which may cause dispersal error to propagate over time, due to advective differences over depth and demonstrate an alternative to laboratory-based behavioral parameterization that encompasses the range of environmental cues that may be acting on planktic organisms. },

abstract = {Dispersal and adaptation both allow species to persist in changing environments. Yet, we have limited understanding of how these processes interact to affect species persistence, especially in diverse communities where biotic interactions greatly complicate responses to environmental change. Here we use a stochastic metacommunity model to demonstrate how dispersal and adaptation to environmental change independently and interactively contribute to biodiversity maintenance. Dispersal provides spatial insurance, whereby species persist on the landscape by shifting their distributions to track favorable conditions. In contrast, adaptation allows species to persist by allowing for evolutionary rescue. But, when species both adapt and disperse, dispersal and adaptation do not combine positively to affect biodiversity maintenance, even if they do increase the persistence of individual species. This occurs because faster adapting species evolve to hold onto their initial ranges (i.e., monopolization effects), thus impeding slower adapting species from shifting their ranges and thereby causing extinctions. Importantly, these differences in adaptation speed emerge as the result of competition, which alters population sizes and colonization success. By demonstrating how dispersal and adaptation each independently and interactively contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity, we provide a framework that links the theories of spatial insurance, evolutionary rescue, and monopolization. This highlights the expectation that the maintenance of biodiversity in changing environments depends jointly on rates of dispersal and adaptation, and, critically, the interaction between these processes.},

MPAs are expected to replenish nearby exploited populations through the natural dispersal of young, but the models that make these predictions rely on assumptions that have recently been demonstrated to be incorrect for most species of fish. A meta-analysis showed that fish reproductive output scales “hyperallometrically” with fish mass, such that larger fish produce more offspring per unit body mass than smaller fish. Because fish are often larger inside MPAs, they should exhibit disproportionately higher reproductive output as compared to fish outside of MPAs. We explore the consequences of hyperallometric reproduction for a range of species for population replenishment and the productivity of exploited species. We show that the reproductive contribution of fish inside MPAs has been systematically underestimated and that fisheries yields can be enhanced by the establishment of reservoirs of larger, highly fecund fish.},

The mean number of alleles and gene diversities, indicating population genetic diversity, was highest in the Z. marina population that was exposed to repeated environmental disturbances, and lowest in the most undisturbed population. The higher genetic diversity in the disturbed population was associated with a higher contribution of sexual reproduction to population persistence. This suggests that both the level of disturbances and the reproductive strategy for population persistence contributed significantly to population genetic diversity at the study sites. According to the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), 76{\%} genetic variation was attributable to differences among individuals within populations. The observed genetic differentiation (FST = 0.241) among Z. marina populations at the study sites appeared to result from reduced meadow size, increased genetic drift, and a high incidence of asexual reproduction. Increased population genetic diversity can enhance resistance and resilience to environmental disturbances; thus, this investigation of seagrass population genetics provides valuable new insights for the conservation, management, and restoration of seagrass habitats.},

Meadow structure strongly reflected the environmental conditions in each habitat. The eutrophicated, protected site had higher biomass of filamentous algae, lower eelgrass biomass and shoot density, longer and narrower leaves, and higher above to below ground biomass ratio compared to the less nutrient-enriched and more exposed site. The faunal community composition and food web structure also differed markedly between sites with the eutrophicated, enclosed site having higher biomass of consumers and less complex food web. These relationships resulted in a column shaped biomass distribution of the consumers at the eutrophicated site whereas the less nutrient-rich site showed a pyramidal biomass distribution of consumers coupled with a more diverse consumer community. The differences in meadow and food web structure of the two seagrass habitats, suggest how physical setting may shape ecosystem response and resilience to anthropogenic pressure. We encourage larger, replicated studies to further disentangle the effects of different environmental variables on seagrass food web structure.},

However, increased flows are projected in some seasons for the Rose Spit, Middle Bank, and Goose Island Bank eddies. More precipitation over the watersheds emptying into coastal waters produces larger freshwater discharges and, in particular, a stronger estuarine flow in Juan de Fuca Strait and a stronger Vancouver Island Coastal Current.

Based on a review of landscape-scale investigations, Fahrig (2017; Ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 48:1-23) reports that biodiversity responses to habitat fragmentation ‘per se' are more often positive rather than negative and concludes that the widespread belief in negative fragmentation effects is a ‘zombie idea'. We show that Fahrig's conclusions are drawn from a narrow and potentially biased subset of available evidence, which ignore much of the observational, experimental and theoretical evidence for negative effects of altered habitat configuration. We therefore argue that Fahrig's conclusions should be interpreted cautiously as they could be misconstrued by policy makers and managers, and we provide six arguments why they should not be applied in conservation decision-making. Reconciling the scientific disagreement, and informing conservation more effectively, will require research that goes beyond statistical and correlative approaches. This includes a more prudent use of data and conceptual models that appropriately partition direct vs indirect influences of habitat loss and altered spatial configuration, and more clearly discriminate the mechanisms underpinning any changes. Incorporating these issues will deliver greater mechanistic understanding and more predictive power to address the conservation issues arising from habitat loss and fragmentation.},

abstract = {Theoretical models predict that spatial self-organization can have important, unexpected implications by affecting the functioning of ecosystems in terms of resilience and productivity. Whether and how these emergent effects depend on specific formulations of the underlying mechanisms are questions that are often ignored. Here, we compare two alternative models of regular spatial pattern formation in mussel beds that have different mechanistic descriptions of the facilitative interactions between mussels. The first mechanism involves a reduced mussel loss rate at high density owing to mutual protection between the mussels, which is the basis of prior studies on the pattern formation in mussels. The second mechanism assumes, based on novel experimental evidence, that mussels feed more efficiently on top of mussel-generated hummocks. Model simulations point out that the second mechanism produces very similar types of spatial patterns in mussel beds. Yet the mechanisms predict a strikingly contrasting effect of these spatial patterns on ecosystem functioning, in terms of productivity and resilience. In the first model, where high mussel densities reduce mussel loss rates, patterns are predicted to strongly increase productivity and decrease the recovery time of the bed following a disturbance. When pattern formation is generated by increased feeding efficiency on hummocks, only minor emergent effects of pattern formation on ecosystem functioning are predicted. Our results provide a warning against predictions of the implications and emergent properties of spatial self-organization, when the mechanisms that underlie self-organization are incompletely understood and not based on the experimental study.},

We present evidence that species interactions may be a significant factor in mediating the regional assembly of the Danish avifauna. Because {\textgreater}95{\%} of breeding species (n = 197) are migratory, we hypothesized that dispersal limitation would not be important and that breeding distributions would largely reflect resource availability and autecological habitat preferences. Instead, we detected a striking pattern of spatial segregation between ecologically similar species at two spatial scales with a suite of null models that factored in the spatial distribution of habitats in Denmark as well as population size and biomass of each species. Habitat utilization analyses indicated that community-wide patterns of spatial segregation could not be attributed to the patchy distribution of habitat or to gross differences in habitat utilization among ecologically similar species. We hypothesize that, when habitat patch size is limited, conspecific attraction in concert with interspecific territoriality may result in spatially segregated distributions of ecologically similar species at larger spatial scales. In the Danish avifauna, the effects of species interactions on community assembly appear pervasive and can be discerned at grain sizes up to four orders of magnitude larger than those of individual territories. These results suggest that species interactions should be incorporated into species distribution modeling algorithms designed to predict species occupancy patterns based on environmental variables.},

More optimistically, we also point to a number of situations where genetic approaches have been particularly successful in the past, as well as newer integrative approaches that deserve further attention},

abstract = {Since November 2014, the Meteorological Services of Canada (MSC) has been running a real-time numerical weather prediction system that provides deterministic forecasts on a regional domain with a 2.5-km horizontal grid spacing covering a large portion of Canada using the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) forecast model. This system, referred to as the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS), is currently downscaled from MSC's operational 10-km GEM-based regional system but uses initial surface fields from a high-resolution (2.5 km) land data assimilation system coupled to the HRDPS and initial hydrometeor fields from the forecast of a 2.5-km cycle, which reduces the spinup time for clouds and precipitation. Forecast runs of 48 h are provided four times daily. The HRDPS was tested and compared to the operational 10-km system. Model runs from the two systems were evaluated against surface observations for common weather elements (temperature, humidity, winds, and precipitation), fractional cloud cover, and also against upper-air soundings, all using standard metrics. Although the predictions of some fields were degraded in some specific regions, the HRDPS generally outperformed the operational system for a majority of the scores. The evaluation illustrates the added value of the 2.5-km model and the potential for improved numerical guidance for the prediction of high-impact weather.},

abstract = {The juvenile stages of fish are often dependent on specific habitat types for their survival. Protecting these habitats may be crucial for maintaining strong adult stocks. The Natura 2000 network of the European Union offers protection of marine habitats that are essential for the recruitment of many fish species. By protecting these critical habitats the network may be important for maintaining the stocks of these fish species. 2.We present a spatially explicit, GIS-based, assessment of two important components of the ecological coherence of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks: representativity and connectivity. Representativity can be measured as the proportion of each conservation feature that is protected, whereas connectivity assesses the spatial configuration of the network. We apply these analyses to study the ecological coherence of the Natura 2000 network in a 30 000-km2 archipelago in the Baltic Sea, with respect to a coastal fish assemblage and associated habitats. The analyses are based on fish distribution maps that have been constructed by statistically relating life stage specific occurrence to environmental variables, and thereafter making spatial predictions based on maps of the environmental variables. 3.The map-based analyses show that both the representativity and the connectivity of the network are poor with respect to the studied fish species. In total, 3.5{\%} (11 km2) of the assemblage recruitment habitat was protected and 48{\%} of the potentially connected habitats were included in the MPA network. 4.The assessment explicitly identified geographical areas, visually communicated using maps, where the network should be improved to ensure ecological coherence. 5.Synthesis and applications.Many MPA networks around the world, such as the Natura 2000 network in Europe, have recently come into effect. Establishment of the networks has often been governed by opportunity rather than by strict ecological analyses, primarily because distribution maps of species and habitats have been unavailable. Map-based assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of evolving MPA networks, such as the one presented here, are needed in adaptive management. They can provide an efficient tool for visualising and communicating the results to stakeholders and policy makers in the process of working towards ecological coherence. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20{\%} of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a powerlaw relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15 - 37{\%} of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (similar to18{\%}) than mid-range (similar to24{\%}) and maximum-change (similar to35{\%}) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

However, rigorous tests are lacking. We couple field-parameterized models of competition between 10 annual plant species with a biodiversity-functioning experiment under two contrasting environmental conditions, to study how coexistence determinants link to biodiversity effects (selection and complementarity). We find that complementarity effects positively correlate with niche differences and selection effects differences correlate with fitness differences. However, niche differences also contribute to selection effects and fitness differences to complementarity effects. Despite this complexity, communities with an excess of niche differences (where niche differences exceeded those needed for coexistence) produce more biomass and have faster decomposition rates under drought, but do not take up nutrients more rapidly. We provide empirical evidence that the mechanisms determining coexistence correlate with those maximizing ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {There has been a recent rise in the number of experiments investigating the effect of dispersal on diversity, with many of the predictions for these tests derived from metacommunity theory. Despite the promise of linking observed relationships between dispersal and diversity to underlying metacommunity processes, empirical studies have faced challenges in providing robust tests of theory. We review experimental studies that have tested how dispersal affects metacommunity diversity to determine why shortcomings emerge, and to provide a framework for empirical tests of theory that capture the processes structuring diversity in natural metacommunities. We first summarize recent experimental work to outline trends in results and to highlight common methods that cause a misalignment between empirical studies and the processes described by theory. We then identify the undesired implications of three widely used experimental methods that homogenize metacommunity structure or species traits, and present alternative methods that have been used to successfully integrate experiments and theory in a biologically relevant way. Finally, we present methodological and theoretical insights from three related ecological fields (coexistence, food web and priority effects theory) that, if integrated into metacommunity experiments, could help isolate the independent and joint effects of local interactions and dispersal on diversity, and reveal the mechanisms underlying observed dispersal–diversity patterns. Together, these methods can provide stronger tests of existing theory and stimulate new theoretical explorations. Synthesis Although metacommunity experiments offer a unique opportunity to test classic and emerging theory on the relationship between dispersal and diversity, several common challenges have hindered robust tests of theory. We outline how emerging theory on the invasion criterion, food webs and priority effects could be help clarify when and how dispersal affects metacommunity diversity, and identify when experimental approaches that homogenize metacommunities fail to test existing theory. By forging better links between theoretical and empirical work, we hope to motivate novel and improved experimental approaches to understanding the joint effects of local and regional processes on diversity.},

@article{Madin2019a,
abstract = {How species interactions shape habitat structure is a longstanding question in ecology. A curious phenomenon reflecting ecological self-organization around reef habitat structures exists on coral reefs: large-scale (hundreds to hundreds of thousands of m2) halo-like patterns surrounding patch reefs, i.e., individual coral reefs that are often separated by seagrass or macroalgal meadows. These “halos,” long known to occur in various locations worldwide, reflect a distinct band of unvegetated sediments surrounding coral patch reefs. However, the full suite of mechanisms controlling them have never been rigorously explored, perhaps due to the common assumption dating back nearly 50 years that they arise solely from reef-based herbivory patterns shaped by anti-predator behavior. Here we provide empirical evidence from a set of halos within Australia's Great Barrier Reef that risk-averse foraging and a previously unrecognized functional group contribute to halo formation, demonstrating that these halos cannot be explained by any one mechanism in isolation. Our results show that halos are a more complex ecological phenomenon than previously assumed by the majority of studies of halos. Specifically, risk-averse grazing by herbivores is likely a key mechanism behind the formation of halos, as generally assumed, but bioturbators also play a central role. This knowledge furthers our understanding of how small-scale species interactions can structure habitat at landscape scales. These large-scale habitat features are important because they affect at least one important ecosystem function, carbon storage, and potentially others (e.g., biological nutrient transfer). These results also raise the question of whether other self-organized ecological patterns may be more nuanced than is currently assumed. This study capitalizes on recent advances in high resolution satellite imagery accessibility that allow ecologists to measure landscape-scale habitat features nearly everywhere on land and in shallow seas. Our results suggest that halos may hold potential as the basis for a tool for remotely observing ecological interactions and measuring large-scale ecosystem change on coral reefs.},

abstract = {There is increasing urgency to implement climate change mitigation strategies that enhance greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Recently, coastal “blue carbon” habitats ‐ mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows ‐ have received attention for their ability to capture CO2 and store organic carbon (OC), primarily in their sediments. Across habitat types and regions, however, information about the sequestration rates and sources of carbon to local sediments remains sparse. Here, we compiled recently obtained estimates of sediment OC stocks and sequestration rates from 139 cores collected from temperate seagrass (Zostera marina) meadows in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Across all cores sediment OC content averaged 0.75{\%}. Organic carbon stocks in the top 25 cm and one meter of the sediment averaged 1,846 and 7,168 g OC m‐2, respectively. Carbon sequestration rates ranged from 4.6 to 93.0 g OC m‐2 yr‐1 and averaged 24.8 g OC m‐2 yr‐1. Isotopic data from this region suggest that OC in the sediments is largely from non‐eelgrass sources. In general, these values are comparable to those from other temperate Z. marina meadows, but significantly lower than previously reported values for seagrasses globally. These results further highlight the need for local and species‐level quantification of blue carbon parameters. While temperate eelgrass meadows may not sequester and store as much carbon as seagrass meadows elsewhere, climate policy incentives should still be implemented to protect existing sediment carbon stocks and the other critical ecosystem services associated with eelgrass habitats.},

In order to investigate the importance of kelp rafts for species dispersal in the Patagonian Fjord Region (PFR), the abundance and distribution pattern of floating kelps (Macrocystis pyrifera, Durvillaea antarctica) and of the invertebrate fauna associated with M. pyrifera were evaluated during austral spring of 2002-2005, 2008 and 2010. In the southernmost Magellan Region (MR), benthic M. pyrifera were additionally sampled to compare the community structures in both conditions. Floating kelps were abundant throughout the entire PFR, harbouring a diverse and abundant invertebrate fauna. The density of floating kelps increased towards the south. In the MR, a loss of species was observed between benthic and floating condition (e. g. decapods, echinoderms, several peracarid species), but a high diversity of organisms from all major phyla were observed on rafts. Throughout the PFR, the predominant rafting species belonged to the peracarids, molluscs and annelids, but the community composition differed between floating samples from the northern and southern zones of the PFR. Relative abundances of peracarids were higher in northern zones, whereas molluscs and annelids dominated in the southern areas. Species of the peracarid genera Peramphithoe, Gondogeneia, Bircenna and Limnoria were shared between all areas. The results suggest that kelp rafts not only contribute to local population connectivity in the PFR, but could also be an important dispersal vehicle for rafting species along the PFR in north-south direction, crossing the biogeographic boundary around Taitao Peninsula. Furthermore, the MR appears to be an important stepping stone for species dispersal via kelp rafting in the subantarctic region. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

We show that persistence of such a population of connected subpopulations depends on whether the sum of the reproductive gains through all possible closed, between-patch reproductive paths through multiple generations, relative to the shortfall in self-persistence in each path, exceeds unity plus extra terms, which only appear if there are four or more patches. These extra terms have the heuristic explanation that they avoid double counting of reproductive paths that arise with four or more patches because there can be nonoverlapping subnetworks. Thus only those patterns of reproduction and connectivity which eventually lead to descendants returning to the patch from which they originate contribute to persistence.

abstract = {Marine ecosystems are threatened by a suite of anthropogenic stressors. Mitigating multiple threats is a daunting task, particularly when funding constraints limit the number of threats that can be addressed. Threats are typically assessed and prioritized via expert opinion workshops that often leave no record of the rationale for decisions, making it difficult to update recommendations with new information. We devised a transparent, repeatable, and modifiable method for collecting expert opinion that describes and documents how threats affect marine ecosystems. Experts were asked to assess the functional impact, scale, and frequency of a threat to an ecosystem; the resistance and recovery time of an ecosystem to a threat; and the certainty of these estimates. To quantify impacts of 38 distinct anthropogenic threats on 23 marine ecosystems, we surveyed 135 experts from 19 different countries. Survey results showed that all ecosystems are threatened by at least nine threats and that nine ecosystems are threatened by {\textgreater}90{\%} of existing threats. The greatest threats (highest impact scores) were increasing sea temperature, demersal destructive fishing, and point-source organic pollution. Rocky reef, coral reef, hard-shelf, mangrove, and offshore epipelagic ecosystems were identified as the most threatened. These general results, however, may be partly influenced by the specific expertise and geography of respondents, and should be interpreted with caution. This approach to threat analysis can identify the greatest threats (globally or locally), most widespread threats, most (or least) sensitive ecosystems, most (or least) threatened ecosystems, and other metrics of conservation value. Additionally, it can be easily modified, updated as new data become available, and scaled to local or regional settings, which would facilitate informed and transparent conservation priority setting.},

The term 'hypothesis' is increasingly misused and critical testing of ideas or theory is restricted to a small minority of studies. This article discusses current microbial ecology research within the context of four approaches: description, induction, inference to the best explanation and deduction. The first three of these do not follow the established scientific method and are not based on scientific ecological questions. Observations are made and sometimes compared with published data, sometimes with attempts to explain findings in the context of existing ideas or hypotheses, but all lack objectivity and are biased by the observations made. By contrast, deductive studies address ecological questions and attempt to explain currently unexplained phenomena through the construction of hypotheses, from mechanism-based assumptions, that generate predictions that are then tested experimentally. Identification of key scientific questions, research driven by meaningful hypotheses and adoption of scientific method are essential for progress in microbial ecology, rather than the current emphasis on descriptive approaches that address only technical challenges. It is, therefore, imperative that we carefully consider and define the fundamental scientific questions that drive our own research and focus on ideas, concepts and hypotheses that can increase understanding, and only then consider which techniques are required for experimental testing. This article is part of the theme issue 'Conceptual challenges in microbial community ecology'.},

abstract = {Most applications of systematic conservation planning have not effectively incorporated biological processes or dynamic threats. We investigated the extent to which connectivity and climate change have been considered in an ecologically meaningful way in marine conservation planning, as an attempt to help formulate conservation objectives for population persistence, over and above representation. Our review of the literature identified 115 marine planning studies that addressed connectivity and 47 that addressed the effects of climate change. Of the statements identified that related to goals and objectives, few were quantitative and justified by ecological evidence for either connectivity (13{\%}) or climate change (8.9{\%}). Most studies addressing connectivity focused on spatial design (e.g. size and spacing) of marine protected areas (MPAs) or clustering of planning units. Climate change recommendations were primarily based on features related to MPA placement (e.g. preferences for areas relatively resilient and resistant to climate change impacts). Quantitative methods to identify spatial or temporal dynamics of features related to connectivity and/or climate change (e.g. functionally well-connected or thermal refugia areas) were rare, and these accounted for the majority of ecologically justified statements. Given these shortcomings in the literature, we outline a framework for setting marine conservation planning objectives that describes six key approaches to more effectively integrate connectivity and climate change into conservation plans, aligning opportunities and minimizing trade-offs between both issues. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Protected area management agencies are increasingly using management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) to better understand, learn from and improve conservation efforts around the globe. Outcome assessment is the final stage of MEE, where conservation outcomes are measured to determine whether management objectives are being achieved. When quantitative monitoring data are available, bestpractice examples of outcome assessments demonstrate that data should be assessed against quantitative condition categories. Such assessments enable more transparent and repeatable integration of monitoring data into MEE, which can promote evidence-based management and improve public accountability and reporting. We interviewed key informants from marine protected area (MPA) management agencies to investigate how scientific data sources, especially long-term biological monitoring data, are currently informing conservation management. Our study revealed that even when long-term monitoring results are available, management agencies are not using them for quantitative condition assessment in MEE. Instead, many agencies conduct qualitative condition assessments, where monitoring results are interpreted using expert judgment only. Whilst we found substantial evidence for the use of long-term monitoring data in the evidence-based management of MPAs, MEE is rarely the sole mechanism that facilitates the knowledge transfer of scientific evidence to management action. This suggests that the first goal of MEE (to enable environmental accountability and reporting) is being achieved, but the second and arguably more important goal of facilitating evidence-based management is not. Given that many MEE approaches are in their infancy, recommendations are made to assist management agencies realize the full potential of long-term quantitative monitoring data for protected area evaluation and evidence-based management.},

Pressure to meet area-coverage and management effectiveness objectives makes it essential to determine how limited conservation funds should be allocated between expanding protected area networks and better enforcing existing reserves. We formally explore this question for the particular case of an exploited species in a partially protected system, using a general model linking protection, enforcement and legal/illegal resource extraction. We show that, on average, funds should be disproportionately invested in enforcement rather than expansion. Further, expansion alone, without additional enforcement, can actually reduce conservation outcomes. To help guide future decisions, we calculate the optimal allocation of resources between these two actions given any current level of enforcement and protected area coverage. In most cases, simultaneously investing in expansion and enforcement is the optimal decision. However, in places with low enforcement and high protection, protected area contraction, or strategically concentrating enforcement effort, produces the greatest benefits.},

Given the diversity of ecosystem services produced or supported by this ecosystem, a better understanding of its structure and function is central to developing an ecosystem-based approach to management. However this region - termed the 'white strip' by marine geologists because of the general lack of high-resolution bathymetric data - is dynamic, highly variable, and difficult to access making data collection challenging and expensive. Since substrate is a key indicator of habitat in this important ecosystem, our objective was to create a continuous substrate map from the best available bottom type data. Such data are critical to assessments of species distributions and anthropogenic risk. Using the Strait of Georgia in coastal British Columbia, Canada, as a case study, we demonstrate how such a map can be created from a diversity of sources. Our approach is simple, quantitative, and transparent making it amenable to iterative improvement as data quality and availability improve. We evaluated the ecological performance of our bottom patches using observed shellfish distributions. We found that observations of geoduck clam, an infaunal species, and red urchins, a species preferentially associated with hard bottom, were strongly and significantly associated with our soft and hard patches respectively. Our description of bottom patches also corresponded well with a more traditional, morphological classification of a portion of the study area. To provide subsequent analyses (such as habitat models) with some confidence in the defined bottom type values, we developed a corresponding confidence surface based on the agreement of, and distance between observations. Our continuous map of nearshore bottom patches thus provides a spatial framework to which other types of data, both abiotic (e.g., energy) and biotic, can be attached. As more data are associated with the bottom patches, we anticipate they will become increasingly useful for representing and developing species-habitat relationships, ultimately leading to a comprehensive representation of the nearshore ecosystem. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

But with this innovation has come complexity. To keep up, ecologists must master multiple specialized software packages, such as ArcGIS for display and manipulation of geospatial data, R for statistical analysis, and MATLAB for matrix processing. This requires a costly investment of time and energy learning computer programming, a high hurdle for many ecologists. To provide easier access to advanced analytic methods, we developed Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET), an extensible collection of powerful, easy-to-use, open-source geoprocessing tools that ecologists can invoke from ArcGIS without resorting to computer programming. Internally, MGET integrates Python, R, MATLAB, and C++, bringing the power of these specialized platforms to tool developers without requiring developers to orchestrate the interoperability between them.In this paper, we describe MGET's software architecture and the tools in the collection. Next, we present an example application: a habitat model for Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) that predicts dolphin presence using a statistical model fitted with oceanographic predictor variables. We conclude by discussing the lessons we learned engineering a highly integrated tool framework. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

abstract = {Advantages of dispersal on the scales that are possible in a long pelagic larval period are not apparent, even for benthic species. An alternative hypothesis is that wide dis-persal may be an incidental byproduct of an ontogenetic migration from and then back to the parental habitat. Under this hypothesis, the water column is a better habitat than the bottom for early development. Because the parental area is often an especially favorable habitat for juveniles and adults, selection may even favor larval retention or larval return rather than dispersal. Where larval capabilities and currents permit, a high percentage of recruits may then be produced from local adults. Expected consequences of a high pro-portion of local recruitment are stronger links between stock and recruitment, greater vulnerability to recruitment overfishing and local modifications of habitat, greater local benefits from fishery reserves, and possibly more localized adaptation within popula-tions. Export of some larvae is consistent with a high proportion of retained or returning larvae, could stabilize populations linked by larval exchange, and provide connectivity between marine reserves. Even a small amount of larval export could account for the greater gene flow, large ranges, and long evolutionary durations seen in species with long pelagic larval stages. The companion papers in this series indicate that local recruitment and retention of locally produced larvae may occur commonly in marine species with pelagic larval stages (Hellberg et al., Sponaugle et al., Swearer et al., Warner and Cowen, this issue). In this paper we first explore evolutionary hypotheses that reconcile the advantages of local retention with the maintenance of a pelagic larval stage. We then discuss evolutionary and demographic consequences of recruitment near the parental area, including the con-sequences for marine conservation. These consequences depend on the magnitudes of dispersal and local recruitment. The incidental dispersal associated with long pelagic larval periods has substantial genetic consequences even while a high proportion of local recruitment has substantial demographic consequences.},

The answer may lie in internal nutrient cycling and/or input from the pelagic zone. Integrating meta-analysis, field data, and population modeling, we show that the ocean's smallest vertebrates, cryptobenthic reef fishes, promote internal reef fish biomass production through extensive larval supply from the pelagic environment. Specifically, cryptobenthics account for two-thirds of reef fish larvae in the near-reef pelagic zone despite limited adult reproductive outputs. This overwhelming abundance of cryptobenthic larvae fuels reef trophodynamics via rapid growth and extreme mortality, producing almost 60{\%} of consumed reef fish biomass. Although cryptobenthics are often overlooked, their distinctive demographic dynamics may make them a cornerstone of ecosystem functioning on modern coral reefs.},

Here, we define and differentiate between process-based and mechanistic features of models, and we identify and discuss important advantages of working with models possessing such features. We describe some of the risks associated with process-based and mechanistic model-centered research programs, and we propose ways to mitigate these risks. Giving process-based and mechanistic models a more central role in research programs can reinvigorate macroecology by strengthening the link between theory and data. Macroecologists are increasingly using process-based and mechanistic models. Process-based models need not be reductionistic.

It is shown that the seasonal variability of the coastal circulation, such as the reversal of the shelf-break current and summer intensification of the California undercurrent, is of mixed origin, with both remote and local forcing contributing importantly. On the other hand, the modeled strong oceanic anomalies associated with the 1997–1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o originate from anomalous conditions on the lateral boundaries, except for the locally forced surface warm anomalies.},

The large body of research in this field has never been quantitatively assessed to identify the manner in which research effort has been expended. We conducted an extensive quantitative literature review of  {\textgreater} 1000 studies and analysed the ‘What?' and the ‘How?' of MPC research. Publication rates increased dramatically in the mid-2000s, due to a surge of studies utilising genetic techniques and assessing larval dispersal, but studies assessing post-larval movement have not increased at the same rate. The MPC literature is dominated by bony fish, {\~{}}3 times more prevalent than the next most common taxonomic class (malacostracan crustaceans). The dispersal of some habitat-forming organisms (e.g. seagrasses, kelps) have been studied extensively (particularly corals), whereas other groups have received minimal attention (e.g. mangroves and saltmarshes). Spatially, studies have been concentrated around Europe, North America and Australia, in contrast to regions such as eastern and southern Asia and western Africa. These taxonomic, habitat and geographic biases are likely to impact our ability to predict and manage for connectivity in these systems due to the large variance in life-history traits and abiotic conditions between well-studied and under studied systems. We recommend that researchers refocus efforts towards under-studied regions, taxa and habitats to obtain a more representative understanding of the scales of connectivity and connectivity's role in maintaining populations.},

abstract = {Accurate maps representing seagrass spatial distribution are essential components for effective monitoring and management of coastal vegetated habitats. Satellite and acoustic remote sensing provide valuable spatial data for seagrass mapping, though few studies have evaluated the complementarity of these methods. In this study, the complementarity of seagrass mapping was assessed through comparison of acoustic and satellite remote-sensing data sets. QuickBird{\textregistered} satellite imagery representing the seagrass landscape of the Richibucto estuary, New Brunswick, Canada, was classified through an object-based procedure and evaluated against a single-beam sonar data set. Acoustic percentage cover values were classified into binary presence/absence format through the application of a decision threshold, allowing comparison with satellite data using the error matrix and derived metrics. Though the binary satellite classification resulted in relatively high accuracy compared with independent ground reference data, agreement between satellite and acoustic data sets was limited. Local differences in seagrass prevalence and patchiness affected classification accuracy, highlighting the potential for under- or overestimating seagrass cover when applying bay-scale classification to areas with different landscape structure. These results emphasize the importance of landscape context in seagrass mapping. Satellite and acoustic remote sensing were seen to fundamentally differ in their depiction of the landscape. Comparison of multiple remote-sensing methods allowed for assessment of complementarity as well as ecologically relevant insight to seagrass spatial dynamics, with implications for mapping and monitoring of seagrass habitats.},

abstract = {Coupled biological and physical oceanographic models are powerful tools for studying connectivity among marine populations because they simulate the movement of larvae based on ocean currents and larval characteristics. However, while the models themselves have been parameterized and verified with physical empirical data, the simulated patterns of connectivity have rarely been compared to field observations. We demonstrate a framework for testing biological-physical oceanographic models by using them to generate simulated spatial genetic patterns through a simple population genetic model, and then testing these predictions with empirical genetic data. Both agreement and mismatches between predicted and observed genetic patterns can provide insights into mechanisms influencing larval connectivity in the coastal ocean. We use a high-resolution ROMS-CoSINE biological-physical model for Monterey Bay, California specifically modified to simulate dispersal of the acorn barnacle, Balanus glandula. Predicted spatial genetic patterns generated from both seasonal and annual connectivity matrices did not match an observed genetic cline in this species at either a mitochondrial or nuclear gene. However, information from this mismatch generated hypotheses testable with our modelling framework that including natural selection, larval input from a southern direction and/or increased nearshore larval retention might provide a better fit between predicted and observed patterns. Indeed, moderate selection and a range of combined larval retention and southern input values dramatically improve the fit between simulated and observed spatial genetic patterns. Our results suggest that integrating population genetic models with coupled biological-physical oceanographic models can provide new insights and a new means of verifying model predictions.},

abstract = {Eelgrass is a sentinel species that can indicate the overall health of a coastal ecosystem. An effective coastal management strategy should therefore map and actively monitor the distribution of this sentinel for any significant changes. While manual transect methods are commonly employed to map eelgrass, the analysis of remote imagery has been proposed as an efficient alternative; a remote sensor can capture large and inaccessible areas cost- and time-effectively, nearly instantly, and with high frequency. The purpose of this study was to explore and compare the efficacy of high spatial resolution airborne (AISA) and satellite (IKONOS) imagery for mapping eelgrass distribution at Sidney Spit, Gulf Islands National Park Reserve of Canada (GINPRC). The primary objective was to determine the optimal spectral resolution, spatial resolution and image processing effort for resolving bed location. A two-meter resolution hyperspectral AISA image and a four-meter resolution multispectral IKONOS image were acquired over Sidney Spit in August 2008. Concurrently collected were in situ above-water hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, underwater videography, and water samples for optical constituent analysis. The images were subjected to varying combinations of 1) image processing steps: atmospheric correction, surface glint correction, deep water masking, and water column removal; 2) image classifiers: with differing user effort and data input requirements; and 3) spectral resolution: {\textgreater} 200-band AISA versus a reduced resolution AISA image (AISA(r)) of only four key bands unique to eelgrass - slope 500-530. nm, first derivatives of 556. nm, 580. nm, and 602. nm (O'Neill et al. (2011)) - versus four-band IKONOS. The highest classification accuracies were achieved with atmospheric correction, glint correction, deep water masking, and maximum likelihood (ML) classification of the AISA(r) image and IKONOS full resolution image. AISA(r) achieved eelgrass producer and user accuracies of 85{\%} in water less than 3. m deep, and 93{\%} in deeper areas. IKONOS achieved 79{\%} for water less than 3. m deep and 91{\%} in deeper areas. Most confusion occurred between eelgrass and green algae, and between exposed eelgrass and other exposed vegetation. The most automated combination of methods yielded poor accuracies but could be greatly improved by refining atmospheric correction input parameters and building on the endmember spectral library. This study resulted in recommendations for remote eelgrass mapping and monitoring within the GINPRC. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Vegetated coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass meadows, and kelp forests are estimated to store carbon up to 12 times faster than terrestrial forests (Fourqurean et al. 2012). Recent estimates suggest that seagrasses, some of the most productive aquatic vegetative plants on the globe, are highly efficient carbon sinks, storing a dis-proportionate amount of carbon for their relatively small area (Duarte 2002; Pendleton et. 2012; Duarte et al. 2013). These blue carbon habitats occupy approximately 0.2{\%} of the global ocean area but have been estimated to account for more than 15{\%} of global marine carbon sequestra-tion (Duarte et al. 2010). Recent assessments suggest that 300,000–600,000 km 2 of Earth's total area is covered in seagrass habitats, potentially storing as much as 19.9 Pg C (Fourqurean et al. 2012).},

abstract = {In 2012, Australia proclaimed a national marine protected area (MPA) system - the National Representative System of MPAs (NRSMPA). Following a change in federal government, the system underwent two major revisions: an independent review released in 2015, and a final plan designed by the Director of National Parks implemented in 2018. We used all three iterations of the NRSMPA, from 2012 to 2018, to compare: 1. the MPA zoning composition, using IUCN protected area categories; 2. the achievement of goals for representing biophysical features; and 3. the potential to mitigate threats to biodiversity from commercial fishing and offshore petroleum extraction. We found that protection levels in the NRSMPA were downgraded in 2018, compared to 2012 and 2015 iterations. Although each iteration met its qualitative goals, the lack of quantitative goals meant that representation of biophysical features was highly uneven and dominated by MPAs offering little protection against the impacts of extractive uses. Moreover, existing areas with value for pelagic longlining, demersal trawling, and offshore petroleum extraction were largely avoided by MPAs, irrespective of their biophysical features. MPAs, especially those with high protection, resulted in little forgone fisheries catch and revenue, likely providing few safeguards for species threatened by fishing. Changes in the NRSMPA over time have left more areas open to fishing, particularly pelagic fishing and notably in the Coral Sea. By focusing on meeting poorly defined representation goals instead of threat reduction, changes to the NRSMPA over time have increased the exposure of Australia's marine biodiversity to known threats.},

abstract = {Sea urchins are important ecosystem engineers in subtidal ecosystems world- wide, providing biogenic structure and altering nutrient dynamics through intensive grazing and drift algal capture. The current work evaluates red urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) density on fixed transects through time, indi- vidual displacement, and urchin-associated benthic community composition using a field-based approach at multiple depths (in and outside of the macroal- gal zone) and replicated across sites in the San Juan Archipelago, Washington. Urchins exhibited no large-scale, temporal or directional changes in density among depths. Furthermore, 87{\%} of individual urchins observed in repeated small-scale surveys over 3 weeks exhibited no change in position. Individual displacement was negatively correlated to drift algal capture. Evidence of seden- tary behavior from the displacement surveys was supported by the sessile and mobile community composition in areas directly under versus adjacent to (con- trol) urchins. The benthos under urchins had a higher percentage of bare space, crustose coralline algae, and increased density of snails, crabs and shrimp relative to associated control plots. Abundance of mobile organisms associating with urchins increased relative to control plots at the deepest survey depth (30 m), indicating a greater strength of interaction with distance from macro- algal production. This work presents evidence of food availability-related behavior in red urchins and indicates that even when sedentary, urchins have a strong influence on ecosystem structure through increasing availability of shel- ter and macroalgal detritus to the benthos.

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

abstract = {Increasing levels of nutrients, persistent hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, and increased frequency of fish kills are degrading the ecological health of the Salish Sea. An improved version of a diagnostic hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model (nutrients, phytoplankton, carbon, dissolved oxygen, and pH) of the Salish Sea has been developed with the ability to simulate characteristic circulation and water quality features. Sensitivity tests were conducted to assess the responsiveness of the system to land-based (rivers and wastewater sources) nutrient loading. The influence of Fraser River on the magnitude of estuarine exchange with the Pacific Ocean and nearshore habitat was examined given that it contributes nearly half of the total freshwater discharged to the Salish Sea. A large region of hypoxia in Hood Canal that extends over 30–40 km during its peak was reproduced and attributed primarily to the existence of a two-layer classic fjord-type circulation and a nearly stagnant deep bottom layer that occupies nearly 60{\%} of the water column. Nitrate mass in the euphotic zone from land-based and oceanic sources is depleted to near-zero limiting levels during summer. Under such conditions, the Salish Sea is responsive to changes in nutrient loads entering the euphotic zone directly. A hypothetical scenario involving the elimination of land-based nutrient sources results in notable water-quality improvement, featuring a reduction in algal biomass (≈5.4{\%}), reduction in sediment oxygen demand (≈17.1{\%}), and significant reduction in hypoxic area (≈39{\%}) and exposure in area-days to bottom layer hypoxia (≈62{\%}) within the Salish Sea.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The authors 2018. The wide distribution range of eelgrass Zostera marina L. encompasses a broad temperature gradient potentially affecting the timing of life history events (phenology), which may also change with global warming. We explored the temperature dependence of eelgrass phenology by analysing published studies reporting the timing of in situ flowering, seed maturation and seedling emergence across a range of latitude (26.8-56.8° N) and annual mean air temperature (6.4-23.7°C). The timing of events changed significantly along the latitude and temperature gradients, being delayed towards northern, colder locations. On average, an increase in annual mean temperature by 1°C advanced the formation of flowering shoots by 12 d and the maturation of seeds by 10.8 d. Seedlings from warmer locations tended to emerge in autumn, whereas coldwater seedlings did not appear until late winter or early spring resulting in an overall advancement of 9.7 d per 1°C increase in annual temperature. The mean monthly temperature associated with specific life history events showed the strongest temperature specificity for maturation of seeds (range 13.5-20.2°C) and largest variability for the emergence of seedlings (range -1 to 20.2°C). Overall, increased latitude resulted in lower temperature thresholds for flowering, seed maturation and emergence of seedlings, indicating that such thresholds are subject to local adaptation or acclimation rather than being universal across the distribution range. Using a time-forspace approach, our results suggest that future warming will result in advanced timing of life history events of eelgrass and increased capacity for sexual reproduction at northern latitudes.},

abstract = {Context: Connectivity, which is a fundamental aspect of any landscape, has been shown to have a nonlinear relationship with the amount of natural habitat, with a marked decrease at intermediate levels of coverage. Impacts on connectivity vary according to how natural habitat is removed. We analyzed connectivity in the Brazilian Cerrado (tropical savanna), a 2 million-km2 biodiversity hotspot. Objectives: We evaluated the effects of habitat removal on connectivity, hypothesizing that a deforestation threshold exists below which connectivity is drastically reduced and that neighboring landscapes have similar patterns of connectivity. Methods: We divided the Cerrado into 624 50 × 50 km cells and used the integral index of connectivity (IIC), available in Conefor software, to evaluate changes in connectivity between 2000 and 2017. We analyzed how the intra, flux, and connector components of connectivity vary with changes in percentage of remaining natural habitat. Results: Between 2000 and 2017, 23.9{\%} of the natural habitat of the Cerrado was lost ({\~{}} 254,000 km2) and connectivity decreased significantly (W = 179,700, p {\textless} 0.01). The most crucial change was the removal of connector fragments or corridors, which occurred in 78.2{\%} of the landscapes. The relationship between IIC and remaining natural area revealed a breakpoint, when native area in a landscape reached 39{\%} in 2000 and 37{\%} in 2017. Conclusions: Regardless of the spatial arrangement of habitat fragments, landscape connectivity is lost when the remaining natural habitat falls below a certain threshold. More restrictive regulations and government permissions should be considered to avoid over-occupation of landscapes.},

abstract = {Aim: To assess confidence in conclusions about climate-driven biological change through time, and identify approaches for strengthening confidence scientific conclusions about ecological impacts of climate change. Location: Global. Methods: We outlined a framework for strengthening confidence in inferences drawn from biological climate impact studies through the systematic integration of prior expectations, long-term data and quantitative statistical procedures. We then developed a numerical confidence index (Cindex) and used it to evaluate current practices in 208 studies of marine climate impacts comprising 1735 biological time series. Results: Confidence scores for inferred climate impacts varied widely from 1 to 16 (very low to high confidence). Approximately 35{\%} of analyses were not associated with clearly stated prior expectations and 65{\%} of analyses did not test putative non-climate drivers of biological change. Among the highest-scoring studies, 91{\%} tested prior expectations, 86{\%} formulated expectations for alternative drivers but only 63{\%} statistically tested them. Higher confidence scores observed in studies that did not detect a change or tracked multiple species suggest publication bias favouring impact studies that are consistent with climate change. The number of time series showing climate impacts was a poor predictor of average confidence scores for a given group, reinforcing that vote-counting methodology is not appropriate for determining overall confidence in inferences. Main conclusions: Climate impacts research is expected to attribute biological change to climate change with measurable confidence. Studies with long-term, high-resolution data, appropriate statistics and tests of alternative drivers earn higher Cindex scores, suggesting these should be given greater weight in impact assessments. Together with our proposed framework, the results of our Cindex analysis indicate how the science of detecting and attributing biological impacts to climate change can be strengthened through the use of evidence-based prior expectations and thorough statistical analyses, even when data are limited, maximizing the impact of the diverse and growing climate change ecology literature.},

Despite high and widespread adult mortality of benthic invertebrates in Baja California, Mexico, that affected populations both within and outside marine reserves, juvenile replenishment of the species that supports local economies, the pink abalone Haliotis corrugata, remained stable within reserves because of large body size and high egg production of the protected adults. Thus, local protection provided resilience through greater resistance and faster recovery of protected populations. Moreover, this benefit extended to adjacent unprotected areas through larval spillover across the edges of the reserves. While climate change mitigation is being debated, coastal communities have few tools to slow down negative impacts of global environmental shifts. These results show that marine protected areas can provide such protection.},

However, a significant gap in knowledge exists in terms of the large scale temporal and spatial dynamics of cover level and distribution of seagrass communities. Remotely sensed satellite imagery offers a means to map seagrass cover and distribution over large temporal and spatial scales. At present, no operational methods have been produced to map seagrass on large spatio-temporal scales ({\textgreater} 100km2). This study presents a combined per-pixel/object-based method to rapidly map seagrass cover and distribution from a full Landsat archive, from 1972-2010 (MSS, TM and ETM+), with no in-situ data and at accuracies as good or better than existing mapping methods. The products provide management agencies with a baseline assessment as well as the capacity to continue to map seagrass distribution and predict changes in the future.},

abstract = {Coral reefs provide ecosystem goods and services for millions of people in the tropics, but reef conditions are declining worldwide. Effective solutions to the crisis facing coral reefs depend in part on understanding the context under which different types of conservation benefits can be maximized. Our global analysis of nearly 1,800 tropical reefs reveals how the intensity of human impacts in the surrounding seascape, measured as a function of human population size and accessibility to reefs (“gravity”), diminishes the effectiveness of marine reserves at sustaining reef fish biomass and the presence of top predators, even where compliance with reserve rules is high. Critically, fish biomass in high-compliance marine reserves located where human impacts were intensive tended to be less than a quarter that of reserves where human impacts were low. Similarly, the probability of encountering top predators on reefs with high human impacts was close to zero, even in high-compliance marine reserves. However, we find that the relative difference between openly fished sites and reserves (what we refer to as conservation gains) are highest for fish biomass (excluding predators) where human impacts are moderate and for top predators where human impacts are low. Our results illustrate critical ecological trade-offs in meeting key conservation objectives: reserves placed where there are moderate-to-high human impacts can provide substantial conservation gains for fish biomass, yet they are unlikely to support key ecosystem functions like higher-order predation, which is more prevalent in reserve locations with low human impacts.},

The relative strength of these forces determines how ecosystems respond to environmental gradients, how much diversity is resident in a community or population at any given time, and how populations reorganize and evolve in response to environmental perturbations. In this study, we introduce a globally resolved population–genetic ocean model in order to examine the interplay of dispersal, selection, and adaptive evolution and their effects on community assembly and global biogeography. We find that environmental selection places strong constraints on global dispersal, even in the face of extremely high assumed rates of adaptation. Changing the relative strengths of dispersal, selection, and adaptation has pronounced effects on community assembly in the model and suggests that barriers to dispersal play a key role in the structuring of marine communities, enhancing global biodiversity and the importance of local historical contingencies.},

abstract = {Abstract A large array of species distribution model (SDM) approaches have been developed for explaining and predicting the occurrences of individual species or species assemblages. Given the wealth of existing models, it is unclear which models perform best for interpolation or extrapolation of existing data sets, particularly when one is concerned with species assemblages. We compared the predictive performance of 33 variants of 15 widely applied and recently emerged SDMs in the context of multispecies data, including both joint SDMs that model multiple species together, and stacked SDMs that model each species individually combining the predictions afterwards. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of these SDM approaches by examining their performance in predicting withheld empirical validation data of different sizes representing five different taxonomic groups, and for prediction tasks related to both interpolation and extrapolation. We measure predictive performance by twelve measures of accuracy, discrimination power, calibration, and precision of predictions, for the biological levels of species occurrence, species richness, and community composition. Our results show large variation among the models in their predictive performance, especially for communities comprising many species that are rare. The results do not reveal any major trade-offs among measures of model performance; the same models performed generally well in terms of accuracy, discrimination, and calibration, and for the biological levels of individual species, species richness, and community composition. In contrast, the models that gave the most precise predictions were not well calibrated, suggesting that poorly performing models can make overconfident predictions. However, none of the models performed well for all prediction tasks. As a general strategy, we therefore propose that researchers fit a small set of models showing complementary performance, and then apply a cross-validation procedure involving separate data to establish which of these models performs best for the goal of the study.

abstract = {Context: Dispersal plays a key role in linking populations, habitat (re)-colonization, and species range expansion. As fragmentation and habitat loss are ubiquitous threats and can disrupt dispersal, landscape connectivity modeling has become a valuable tool in conservation planning. Objectives: We provide an overview of how current connectivity modeling has incorporated the different aspects of animal dispersal. We describe the most popular connectivity models and highlight their main assumptions related to dispersal, suggesting a series of questions that could clarify the advantages and disadvantages of using a particular approach. Methods: We review the structure of the connectivity models based on least-cost analysis, circuit theory, and the individual-based dispersal models. We use some studies as case examples to discuss how important elements of animal dispersal were considered through models to predict movement routes. Results: Ongoing developments in connectivity modeling have made it possible to represent animal dispersal in a more realistic way by implementing key elements such as dispersal behaviors, mortality, and inter-individual variability. However, the potential to consider such elements and how this is done in connectivity modeling depends on the selected approach, since each model represents animal dispersal through a different perspective. Conclusions: We recommend that the choice of a connectivity model should be made after considering the study objectives, the species dispersal mechanism, and the prior knowledge available about it. By understanding and incorporating dispersal behavior into connectivity modeling, we can improve our capacity to generate useful information aimed to construct more effective conservation strategies.},

People in this zone are concentrated in coastal cities that are hubs for transport and trade ? which transform the marine environment. Here, we review the impacts of three interacting drivers of marine urbanization (resource exploitation, pollution pathways and ocean sprawl) and discuss key characteristics that are symptomatic of urban marine ecosystems. Current evidence suggests these systems comprise spatially heterogeneous mosaics with respect to artificial structures, pollutants and community composition, while also undergoing biotic homogenization over time. Urban marine ecosystem dynamics are often influenced by several commonly observed patterns and processes, including the loss of foundation species, changes in biodiversity and productivity, and the establishment of novel assemblages, ruderal species and synanthropes. Further, we discuss potential urban acclimatization and adaptation among marine taxa, interactive effects of climate change and marine urbanization, and ecological engineering strategies for enhancing urban marine ecosystems. By assimilating research findings across disparate disciplines, we aim to build the groundwork for urban marine ecology ? a nascent field; we also discuss research challenges and future directions for this new field as it advances and matures. Ultimately, all sides of coastal city design: architecture, urban planning, and civil and municipal engineering, will need to prioritize the marine environment if negative effects of urbanization are to be minimized. In particular, planning strategies that account for the interactive effects of urban drivers and accommodate complex system dynamics could enhance the ecological and human functions of future urban marine ecosystems.

abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess," given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species-the subjectmatter of community ecology-are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.

However, ecologists still argue about how fragmentation of habitat (independent of habitat loss) affects species richness. The recently proposed habitat amount hypothesis posits that species richness only depends on the total amount of habitat in a local landscape. On the other hand, different empirical studies report contrasting patterns: some find positive and others negative effects of fragmentation per se on species richness. To explain this apparent disparity, we devise a stochastic, spatially-explicit model of competitive species communities in heterogeneous habitats. The model shows that habitat loss and fragmentation have a non-monotone and non-linear effect on the species diversity in competitive communities. When the total amount of habitat is large, fragmentation per se tends to increase species diversity, but if the total amount of habitat is small, the situation is reversed: fragmentation per se decreases species diversity.},

The animals were caught semi-quantitatively by sweeping a net over a known distance at the water surface above the algal belts every 3 h. Neomysis vulgaris, Praunus spp., and Idothea spp. were all taken almost exclusively in the catches between 21.00 h and 03.00 h. Of the chief environmental parameters only illumination showed a corresponding variation. Field and laboratory experiments on the influence of light were carried out with Gammarus oceanicus, Idothea baltica and Idothea chelipes. A single specimen per dish was put in Petri dishes containing habitat water and a piece of Fucus and the activity was noted every other hour. In experiments under natural light conditions the activity of Gammarus oceanicus increased significantly when light intensity dropped to a few lux and fell again when values of a few thousand lux were attained. Idothea baltica and Idothea chelipes showed a distinct increase in swimming activity when light intensities fell below one lux and the period of inactivity began at 400-800 lux. In experiments with successive periods of constant dark or constant light all three species were inactive in light, active in dark. The close correlation between field and laboratory responses was further confirmed by light-alternative experiments with Gammarus oceanicus and Idothea baltica: of the two alternatives offered namely 2500-3000 lux and dark, nearly all the 10 individuals of both species chose the dark. This relationship between the activity of the animals and illumination may be of survival value in the presence of a large number of predators, especially fish. Night is very important as being most favourable to large scale dispersal. {\textcopyright} 1968.},

This study aims at providing the first overview of the functionality of the PA networks across the six continents at different dispersal distances relevant for terrestrial mammals. Location: Global. Methods: We used a graph theory approach to assess the connectivity of PA networks of different continents across a wide range of dispersal distances. We assessed the connectivity of country-level PA networks, the connectivity of continental PA networks and the contribution of country-level PA networks to continental connectivity. Results: National and continental networks are characterized by very different spatial arrangements that translate into different levels of connectivity, ranging from networks where the reachable area is mostly determined by structural connectivity within PAs (e.g. Africa) to networks where connectivity mostly depends on animal dispersal among PAs (e.g. Europe). PA size correlates positively with connectiv ity for all species, followed by PA number; dispersal contributes less and positively interacts with number of PAs. Main conclusions: Continental networks perform worse than national networks. Transboundary connectivity is often weak and should be improved, especially for countries that are important in promoting continental connectivity. Increasing PA coverage and size is a good strategy to improve multispecies connectivity.},

abstract = {Creating accurate maps of seagrass cover is a challenging procedure in coastal waters with variable water clarity and depths. This paper presents an approach for mapping seagrass cover from data sources commonly collected by natural resource management agencies responsible for coastal environments. The aim of the study was to develop an approach for mapping classes of seagrass cover from field and/or image data for an area with variable water clarity and depths. The study was carried out in Moret{\'{o}}n Bay in eastern Australia. A Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite image was acquired for the same area in August 2004. The image data were used to map seagrass cover in the exposed inter-tidal and clear shallow water areas to depths of 3 m. Field survey data were collected, in July - August 2004, to map deep ({\textgreater} 3 m) and turbid sub-tidal areas, using: real time video, snorkeller observations and transect surveys . The resulting maps were combined into a single layer of polygons, with the same seagrass cover classes used as existing mapping programs and with each polygon assigned to one of five cover classes (0 {\%}, 1-25 {\%}, 25-50 {\%}, 50-75 {\%}, 75-100 {\%}). As independent field data were not available for accuracy assessment, a reliability assessment indicated that {\textgreater} 75 percent of the Bay was mapped with high categorical reliability. Most previously published seagrass mapping projects covered areas {\textless} 400 km 2, were based on single data sets, and lacked assessment of accuracy or reliability. Our approach and methods address this gap and present guidelines for a generally applicable method to integrate image and field data sets over large areas ({\textgreater} 1000 km 2) commonly used for monitoring and management.},

abstract = {Most plant, animal and microbial species of widely varying body size and lifestyle are nearly equally fit as evidenced by their coexistence and persistence through millions of years. All organisms compete for a limited supply of organic chemical energy, derived mostly from photosynthesis, to invest in the two components of fitness: survival and production. All organisms are mortal because molecular and cellular damage accumulates over the lifetime; life persists only because parents produce offspring. We call this the equal fitness paradigm. The equal fitness paradigm occurs because: (1) there is a trade-off between generation time and productive power, which have equal-but-opposite scalings with body size and temperature; smaller and warmer organisms have shorter lifespans but produce biomass at higher rates than larger and colder organisms; (2) the energy content of biomass is essentially constant, {\~{}}22.4 kJ g−1 dry body weight; and (3) the fraction of biomass production incorporated into surviving offspring is also roughly constant, {\~{}}10–50{\%}. As organisms transmit approximately the same quantity of energy per gram to offspring in the next generation, no species has an inherent lasting advantage in the struggle for existence. The equal fitness paradigm emphasizes the central importance of energy, biological scaling relations and power–time trade-offs in life history, ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {Ecology is awash with theory, but everywhere the literature is bereft. Many papers in ecology do not even reference their theoreti- cal context, while only a small minority are engaged in what is sup- posed to be the heart of the scientific enterprise: theory testing. I will demonstrate these assertions with an analysis of the current and historical literature. First, though, let us examine the roles that theory plays in ecology, and all of science. Theories are the way in which we organise our ideas and turn data into knowledge. They provide a means for laying bare the assumptions that underlie our models and experiments. They pro- vide guidelines for building models (a particular kind of theory). They provide the rationale for where we look in the world and help us interpret what we see. Contrary to some claims, there is no such thing as theory-free science. All observations presuppose a theoreti- cal context. For example, the simple act of counting individuals and assessing species diversity relies on the concepts of ‘individual' and ‘species,' both of which are complex ideas (e.g. Wheeler {\&} Meier 2000; Strassmann {\&} Queller 2010). Perhaps more importantly, our theories are what give us warrant to take what we learn in one place and apply it to another. When we begin a prairie restoration project, we rely not just on previous projects, but general knowledge about successional processes, competitive hierarchies and mutualistic inter- actions. When we finish our project, we can add what we have learned at this place to the general pool of knowledge through our theoretical constructs. Hence, theories allow us to generalise from specific studies to overarching concepts.},

abstract = {The metacommunity concept has the potential to integrate local and regional dynamics within a general community ecology framework. To this end, the concept must move beyond the discrete archetypes that have largely defined it (e.g. neutral vs. species sorting) and better incorporate local scale species interactions and coexistence mechanisms. Here, we present a fundamental reconception of the framework that explicitly links local coexistence theory to the spatial processes inherent to metacommunity theory, allowing for a continuous range of competitive community dynamics. These dynamics emerge from the three underlying processes that shape ecological communities: 1) density-independent responses to abiotic conditions, 2) density-dependent biotic interactions, and 3) dispersal. Stochasticity is incorporated in the demographic realization of each of these processes. We formalize this framework using a simulation model that explores a wide range of competitive metacommunity dynamics by varying the strength of the underlying processes. Using this model and framework, we show how existing theories, including the traditional metacommunity archetypes, are linked by this common set of processes. We then use the model to generate new hypotheses about how the three processes combine to interactively shape the diversity, functioning, and stability of metacommunities that can direct the study of communities in nature.},

abstract = {Synthesising the relationships between complexity, connectivity, and the stability of large biological systems has been a longstanding fundamental quest in theoretical biology and ecology. With the many exciting developments in modern network theory, interest in these issues has recently come to the forefront in a range of multidisciplinary areas. Here we outline a new theoretical analysis specifically relevant for the study of ecological metapopulations focusing primarily on marine systems, where subpopulations are generally connected via larval dispersal. Our work determines the qualitative and quantitative conditions by which dispersal and network structure control the persistence of a set of age-structured patch populations. Mathematical modelling combined with a graph theoretic analysis demonstrates that persistence depends crucially on the topology of cycles in the dispersal network which tend to enhance the effect of larvae "returning home." Our method clarifies the impact directly due to network structure, but this almost by definition can only be achieved by examining the simplified case in which patches are identical; an assumption that we later relax. The methodology identifies critical migration routes, whose presence are vital to overall stability, and therefore should have high conservation priority. In contrast, "lonely links," or links in the network that do not participate in a cyclical component, have no impact on persistence and thus have low conservation priority. A number of other intriguing criteria for persistence are derived. Our modelling framework reveals new insights regarding the determinants of persistence, stability, and thresholds in complex metapopulations. In particular, while theoretical arguments have, in the past, suggested that increasing connectivity is a destabilizing feature in complex systems, this is not evident in metapopulation networks where connectivity, cycles, coherency, and heterogeneity all tend to enhance persistence. The results should be of interest for many other scientific contexts that make use of network theory. {\textcopyright} 2010 Artzy-Randrup, Stone.},

abstract = {The marine habitats of the Philippines are recognized to be some of the most biodiverse systems globally yet only 1.7{\%} of its seas are designated as marine protected areas (MPAs) with varying levels of implementation. Many of these MPAs were established based on local-scale conservation and fisheries objectives without considering larger-scale ecological connections. The connectivity of reefs through larval dispersal is important in the regional-scale resilience against anthropogenic disturbances and is considered a significant criterion in planning for MPAs. In this study, we provide insights into the delineation of ecologically connected MPA networks using larval dispersal modeling and network analysis. We characterized the network properties of the Philippine coral reefs, organized as 252 reef nodes, based on the larval connectivity networks of a branching coral, sea urchin, and grouper. We then evaluated the distribution of the existing 1,060 MPAs relative to the connectivity patterns. All reef nodes were found to be highly interconnected with a mean shortest path ranging from 1.96 to 4.06. Reef nodes were then ranked according to their relative importance in regional connectivity based on five connectivity indices. Despite the between-organism and between-index variability in rankings, there were reefs nodes, mostly located offshore and at major straits, which consistently ranked high. We found that the distribution of existing MPAs partially capture some of the regional connectivity functions but there is a spatial mismatch between the primarily coastal MPAs and the high-ranking reef nodes. Furthermore, network partitioning identified subnetworks and dispersal barriers. The existing MPAs were found to be disproportionately distributed to a few subnetworks and that the largest subnetworks do not contain the greatest number of MPAs. Considering these gaps, we suggest expanding the coverage of protected areas especially in underrepresented reef networks to meaningfully capture national-scale connectivity and meet global conservation objectives.},

            {\textless}p{\textgreater}The world's oceans are subject to the influence of climate change at all latitudes and depths. There is a growing body of literature on the responses of species to climate change, which has a strong deterministic component indicating that responses can be predicted. At the same time, advances in oceanographic data acquisition and modeling have facilitated the identification of potential climate change refugia. The Convention on Biological Diversity's “Voluntary Specific Workplan on Biodiversity in Cold‐Water Areas within the Jurisdictional Scope of the Convention” explicitly calls for the identification and protection of refugia in cold‐water areas. We propose adding “Climate Change Refugium” as an integral consideration for identification of Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs). We provide a description of this as a potential eighth criterion. We then briefly discuss the pros and cons of introducing this eighth criterion, or an alternative strategy to develop guidelines that explicitly link refugia to the rationale of existing EBSA criteria, in the hope that this opinion piece will launch further discussion on this notion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have grown exponentially, emerging as a widespread tool to conserve biodiversity and enhance fisheries production. Although numerous empirical studies and global syntheses have evaluated the effects of MPAs on community structure (e.g., biodiversity), no broad assessment concerning their capacity to influence ecological processes (e.g., species interactions) exists. Here, we present meta‐analyses that compare rates of predation and herbivory on a combined 32 species across 30 MPAs spanning 85° of latitude. Our analyses synthesize the fate of 15,225 field experiment assays, and demonstrate that MPAs greatly increased predation intensity on animals but not herbivory on macroalgae or seagrass. Predation risk, quantified as the odds of prey being eaten, was largely determined by predator abundance and biomass within reserves. At MPAs with the greatest predator accumulation, the odds of predation increased to nearly 49:1, as opposed to 1:1 at MPAs where predators actually declined. Surprisingly, we also found evidence that predation risk declined with increased sea‐surface temperature. Greater predation risk within MPAs was consistent with predator and prey population abundance estimates, where predators increased 4.4‐fold within MPAs, whereas prey decreased 2.2‐fold. For herbivory, the lack of change may have been driven by functional redundancy and the inability of reserves to increase herbivore abundance relative to fished zones in our sample. Overall, this work highlights the capacity of MPAs to restore a critical ecosystem function such as predation, which mediates energy flows and community assembly within natural systems. However, our review of the literature also uncovers relatively few studies that have quantified the effects of MPAs on ecosystem function, highlighting a key gap in our understanding of how protected areas may alter ecological processes and deliver ecosystem services. From a historical perspective, these findings suggest that modern levels of predation in the coastal oceans may currently only be a fraction of the baseline prior to human exploitation.},

Theory suggests that a reserve network will function synergistically when connected by dispersal, but the scale of dispersal is often unknown. On the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada, both countries have recently implemented a number of rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) to protect exploited rockfish species, but no study has evaluated the connectivity within networks in each country or between the two countries. We used isolation-by-distance theory to estimate the scale of dispersal from microsatellite data in the black rockfish, Sebastes melanops, and compared this estimate with the distance between RCAs that would protect this species. Within each country, we found that the distance between RCAs was generally within the confidence intervals of mean dispersal per generation. The distance between these two RCA networks, however, was greater than the average dispersal per generation. The data were also consistent with a genetic break between southern Oregon and central Oregon. We discuss whether additional nearshore RCAs in southern Oregon and Washington would help promote connectivity between RCA's for shallow-water rockfishes.},

abstract = {Our ability to project changes to the climate via anthropogenic forcing has steadily increased over the last five decades. Yet, biologists still lack accurate projections about climate change impacts. Despite recent advances, biologists still often rely on correlative approaches to make projections, ignore important mechanisms, develop models with limited coordination, and lack much of the data to inform projections and test them. In contrast, atmospheric scientists have incorporated mechanistic data, established a global network of weather stations, and apply multi-model inference by comparing divergent model projections. I address the following questions: How have the two fields developed through time? To what degree does biological projection differ from climate projection? What is needed to make similar progress in biological projection? Although the challenges in biodiversity projections are great, I highlight how biology can make substantial progress in the coming years. Most obstacles are surmountable and relate to history, lag times, scientific culture, international organization, and finances. Just as climate change projections have improved, biological modeling can improve in accuracy by incorporating mechanistic understanding, employing multi-model ensemble approaches, coordinating efforts worldwide, and validating projections against records from a well-designed network of biotic stations. Now that climate scientists can make better projections of climate change, biologists need to project and prevent its impacts on biodiversity.

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) form the cornerstone of marine conservation. Identifying which factors contribute to their success or failure is crucial considering the international conservation targets for 2020 and the limited funds generally available for marine conservation. We identified common factors of success and/or failure of MPA effectiveness using peer-reviewed publications and first-hand expert knowledge for 27 case studies around the world. We found that stakeholder engagement was considered as the most important factor affecting MPA success, and equally, its absence, was the most important factor driving failure. Conversely, while some factors were identified as critical for success, their absence was not considered as a driver of failure, and vice versa. This mismatch provided impetus for considering these factors more critically. Bearing in mind that most MPAs have multiple objectives, including non-biological, this highlights the need for the development and adoption of standardized effectiveness metrics, besides biological considerations, to measure factors contributing to the success or failure of MPAs to reach their objectives. Considering our conclusions, we suggest the development of specific protocols for the assessment of stakeholder engagement, the role of leadership, the capacity of enforcement and compliance with MPAs objectives. Moreover, factors defining the success and failure of MPAs should be assessed not only by technical experts and the relevant authorities, but also by other stakeholder groups whose compliance is critical for the successful functioning of an MPA. Combining these factors with appropriate ecological, social, and economic data should then be incorporated into adaptive management to improve MPA},

We then describe the degree to which projections of future species richness differ, employing both modelling approaches across multiple emissions scenarios. Location USA and Canada. Methods We use Audubon Christmas Bird Count and North American Breeding Bird Survey data to estimate current and future species richness of birds using two distinct approaches. In the first, we model richness by stacking predictions from individual species distribution models. In the second, we model richness directly, ignoring the contributions of specific taxa to richness estimates. Results The two modelling approaches show similar accuracies when validated with historical observations, particularly winter observations, and result in similar patterns of richness when projected onto current and future climate spaces. Patterns of projected change in species richness differed markedly between winter and summer seasons regardless of modelling approach. Our models suggest that bird species richness in winter will increase or remain stable across much of North America. In contrast, species richness in summer is projected to decrease over much of North America, except part of northern Canada, suggesting that climate may constrain many breeding bird species and communities in the future. Main conclusions Stacked species distribution models and macroecological models produce similar estimates of current and future species richness for each of two seasons despite being built on different concepts of community assembly. Our results suggest that, although the mechanisms that shape geographical variation in biodiversity remain uncertain, these limitations do not impede our ability to predict patterns of species richness at broad scales. Congruence of species richness projections across modelling approaches is encouraging for conservation planning efforts that focus on retaining biodiversity into the future.},

The temperature sensitivity of GPP is directly linked to photosynthetic physiology, but the response of GPP to warming over longer timescales could also be shaped by ecological and evolutionary processes that drive variation community structure and functional trait distributions. Here, we show that selection on photosynthetic traits within and across taxa dampen the effects of temperature on GPP across a catchment of geothermally heated streams. Autotrophs from cold streams had higher photosynthetic rates and after accounting for differences in biomass among sites, rates of ecosystem-level GPP were independent of temperature, despite a 20 °C thermal gradient. Our results suggest that thermal adaptation constrains the long-term temperature dependence of GPP, and highlights the importance of considering physiological, ecological and evolutionary mechanisms when predicting how ecosystem-level processes respond to warming.},

abstract = {Communities assemble through a combination of stochastic processes, which can make environmentally similar communities divergent (high beta-diversity), and deterministic processes, which can make environmentally similar communities convergent (low beta-diversity). Top predators can influence both stochasticity (e.g. colonization and extinction events) and determinism (e.g. size of the realized species pool), in community assembly, and thus their net effect is unknown. We investigated how predatory fish influenced the scaling of prey diversity in ponds at local and regional spatial scales. While fish reduced both local and regional richness, their effects were markedly more intense at the regional scale. Underlying this result was that the presence of fish made localities within metacommunities more similar in their community composition (lower beta-diversity), suggesting that fish enhance the deterministic, relative to the stochastic, components of community assembly. Thus, the presence of predators can alter fundamental mechanisms of community assembly and the scaling of diversity within metacommunities.},

These long term shifts are related to shifts in the intensity of winter storms and cloudiness. A more dramatic shift is seen in the interannual variation in timing with the standard deviation over seven consecutive years doubling during the timeseries. Since the early 1990s there have been a few, very early blooms leading to a large interannual spread in bloom times.

Here we describe the new Conefor Sensinode 2.2 (CS22) software, which quantifies the importance of habitat patches for maintaining or improving functional landscape connectivity and is conceived as a tool for decision-making support in landscape planning and habitat conservation. CS22 is based on graph structures, which have been suggested to possess the greatest benefit to effort ratio for conservation problems regarding landscape connectivity. CS22 includes new connectivity metrics based on the habitat availability concept, which considers a patch itself as a space where connectivity occurs, integrating in a single measure the connected habitat area existing within the patches with the area made available by the connections between different habitat patches. These new metrics have been shown to present improved properties compared to other existing metrics and are particularly suited to the identification of critical landscape elements for connectivity.

Here, I briefly review four fields of marine biology that each differentially illuminate the scale of marine neighborhoods: effects of marine reserves, tagging studies, microchemistry, and population genetics. These suggest adult neighborhood sizes for many demersal fish and invertebrates as small as kilometers and up to 10 to 100 km. Larval dispersal may be shorter than previously suspected: neighborhood sizes of 10 to 100 km for invertebrates and 50 to 200 km for fish are common in current compilations. How can small reserves protect such species? One conceptual framework is to set reserve size based on adult neighborhood sizes of highly fished species and determine spacing of a reserve network based on larval neighborhoods. The multispecies nature of fisheries demands that network designs accommodate different life histories and take into account the way local human communities use marine resources.},

Thus the configuration (size, spacing and location) of$\backslash$nindividual reserves within a network should be informed by larval$\backslash$ndispersal and movement patterns of the species for which protection is$\backslash$nrequired. In the past, empirical data regarding larval dispersal and$\backslash$nmovement patterns of adults and juveniles of many tropical marine$\backslash$nspecies have been unavailable or inaccessible to practitioners$\backslash$nresponsible for marine reserve design. Recent empirical studies using$\backslash$nnew technologies have also provided fresh insights into movement$\backslash$npatterns of many species and redefined our understanding of connectivity$\backslash$namong populations through larval dispersal. Our review of movement$\backslash$npatterns of 34 families (210 species) of coral reef fishes demonstrates$\backslash$nthat movement patterns (home ranges, ontogenetic shifts and spawning$\backslash$nmigrations) vary among and within species, and are influenced by a range$\backslash$nof factors (e.g. size, sex, behaviour, density, habitat characteristics,$\backslash$nseason, tide and time of day).

abstract = {A shortage of dissolved oxygen in seawater can adversely impact marine life and ecosystems. Coastal waters deeper than 100 m do not gain oxygen directly from the surface, and thus transient, seasonal, or permanent oxygen deficit conditions can occur in such deeper coastal waters. A low oxygen, dense pool of water is formed every summer over the mid-shelf off southwest Vancouver Island in the Juan de Fuca Eddy region, known for its high primary productivity. In this thesis, the waters of the dense pool are traced back to their source using Lagrangian Particle tracking and a regional numerical ocean model, and upwelling hotspots of deep water leading to the pool are discovered. The model accuracy in simulating the local circulation is evaluated based on a statistical skill score, root mean square error and bias upon comparing the model variables to the observations. The numerical model simulates the local circulation well, except it under-predicts the variation along isopycnals. Due to this lack of variation in the model, only the particles which agree well between the model results and the observations are selected using a K-Means clustering algorithm. Tracking these particles backwards in time showed that the dense pool under the Juan de Fuca Eddy is primarily composed of water from the California Undercurrent, water from Washington State shelf and offshore water. Signatures from mixing the source waters in proportion closely approximate the final signatures of water inside the dense pool. The investigation of upwelling hotspots revealed that 1) the dense pool water primarily upwells through Spur Canyon and the convoluted Juan de Fuca Canyon bathymetry near Swiftsure Bank, and 2) The southern side of Nitinat Canyon acts as a dominant upwelling site for water ending on the south-outer shelf of South Vancouver Island. This study helps in climate change predictions, as the pathways identified for different source water origins help to determine the change in source composition over time and understand the potential low dissolved oxygen implications over the Vancouver Island shelf, in Juan de Fuca Strait and in the Strait of Georgia.},

abstract = {Decision-makers focus on representing biodiversity pattern, maintaining connectivity, and strengthening resilience to global warming when designing marine protected area (MPA) systems, especially in coral reef ecosystems. The achievement of these broad conservation objectives will likely require large areas, and stretch limited funds for MPA implementation. We undertook a spatial prioritisation of Brazilian coral reefs that considered two types of conservation zones (i.e. no-take and multiple use areas) and integrated multiple conservation objectives into MPA planning, while assessing the potential impact of different sets of objectives on implementation costs. We devised objectives for biodiversity, connectivity, and resilience to global warming, determined the extent to which existing MPAs achieved them, and designed complementary zoning to achieve all objectives combined in expanded MPA systems. In doing so, we explored interactions between different sets of objectives, determined whether refinements to the existing spatial arrangement of MPAs were necessary, and tested the utility of existing MPAs by comparing their cost effectiveness with an MPA system designed from scratch. We found that MPAs in Brazil protect some aspects of coral reef biodiversity pattern (e.g. threatened fauna and ecosystem types) more effectively than connectivity or resilience to global warming. Expanding the existing MPA system was as cost-effective as designing one from scratch only when multiple objectives were considered and management costs were accounted for. Our approach provides a comprehensive assessment of the benefits of integrating multiple objectives in the initial stages of conservation planning, and yields insights for planners of MPAs tackling multiple objectives in other regions.},

abstract = {Efforts to understand the population dynamics of marine species with planktonic larvae have been stymied by the fact that the larvae recruiting to a location have little chance of originating from that site. Patterns of larval movement and the spatial scale of dispersal are expected to be major forces regulating the dynamics of marine populations and communities. Unfortunately, the scale and predictability of larval dispersal and its regulation by physical circulation remains unknown due largely to the impossibility of measuring dispersal in open marine environments. Here we exploit strong genetic differentiation among marine mussel populations in southwest England to measure larval dispersal among adjoining genetic patches. This approach allows estimates of larval dispersal over relatively great distances. We combine these measurements with results from a high-resolution model of coastal circulation to test the hypothesis that larval dispersal is regulated by physical circulation. We show that larval dispersal typically occurs over distances of ;30 km but in some cases was at least 64 km. The circulation model accurately predicted general patterns of larval transport between genetic regions, the scale of larval dispersal, and genetic isolation created by physical barriers to circulation. We demonstrate that physical circulation models and genetic measures of larval transport can be coupled to assess the geographic scale of larval dispersal in marine environments.},

Vertical distributions were recorded over 90. min in rectangular plexiglass thermocline chambers designed to regulate the temperature of a central observation compartment to the desired values. The temperature in the bottom water layer (B) and the temperature difference between layers ($\delta$T) were manipulated in an orthogonal design. We used, for S. droebachiensis: 4 levels of $\delta$T (0, 3, 6 and 12 °C) and 3 levels of B (3, 6 and 9 °C); for A. rubens: 3 levels $\delta$T (0, 6 and 12 °C) and 2 levels of B (6 and 12 °C); and for A. irradians: 3 levels of $\delta$T (0, 5 and 11 °C) and 2 levels of B (5 and 11 °C). The difference in temperature between water layers did not affect the vertical distribution of echinoderms consistently, while the distribution of A. irradians was limited to the bottom layer when any thermal stratification was present regardless of strength. Our results suggest that the vertical position of larvae of S. droebachiensis and A. rubens is related to the temperatures of the surface layer and that the presence alone or the steepness of the thermocline has less influence on their distribution. Consequently, in the field, echinoderm larvae would aggregate at the surface unless temperature extremes were encountered. In contrast, the position of A. irradians was limited to the bottom layer in the presence of a thermocline of at least 5 °C (the shallowest used in our study). Such thermoclines are common in a natural setting and could affect the vertical distribution and horizontal dispersal of larvae by acting as a barrier to vertical migration. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Instead, most field studies have focussed on the importance of patch area, isolation and edge effects. I demonstrate that passively dispersed seagrass epifauna respond to the shape and orientation of artificial seagrass patches when currents, the dispersal mechanism, are strong, but not when they are weak. Orientation is important because animals dispersing via tidally induced water currents move predominantly in a single direction, and thus patches oriented across the current intercept more potential colonists than do those patches oriented perpendicular to the current. Currents less affect taxa that actively disperse, or that are relatively sedentary. Fish species that tend to use intertidal areas at high tide, however, were more abundant in patches perpendicular to shore (and parallel to the current), presumably because these patches offer the greatest amount of edge to animals undergoing tidal migrations.},

abstract = {The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is the most pernicious of problems. The fact that it is so obvious and so general-the overabundance of species in the tropics was recognized long before there were even ecologists around to describe it-strongly suggests that the explanation should be a simple one; yet distinguishing between alternative simple explanations has proven, well, complicated. However, as Worm and Tittensor (hereafter W{\&}T) remind us in their new book A Theory of Global Biodiversity [1], there is not one, but many LDGs: different environments and different taxa show a variety of patterns , both today and throughout geological history; of course for many taxa, diversity is highest at low latitudes, but there is considerable variation around both the mean and variance of these distributions. This diversity of diversity gradients may provide biologists with the clues and statistical power to tease apart the influence of various causes. In their book, W{\&}T curate an incredibly vast dataset of species richness by site and walk the reader through many taxon-specific diversity gradients in four broad types of ecosystems. One of these four is terrestrial and the other three-coastal, pelagic, and the deep sea-are marine. This whole earth catalog is delightful reading even without the theoretical context; I learned a tremendous amount about what lives where and was also taken aback by just how little we know about a large portion of our planet (surveys of deep sea diversity are particularly sparse; we are just starting to uncover major new biodiversity patterns [2]). With this distri-butional information in hand, W{\&}T comb through the literature and evaluate global associations between diversity and environmental correlates; this is also a valuable synthesis of a dizzying array of data and hypotheses. Through all of this, they identify three drivers of diversity that appear over and over again in many groups and environments: temperature, area, and productivity. So how does one take this information and formulate an explanation for diversity gra-dients? W{\&}T's approach is to construct a novel simulation model containing a minimal set of parameters that tie into each of the drivers they have identified and then try to recapitulate (relative) biodiversity patterns by running this model across a geographical landscape modeled after the real world (see [3] for a review and discussion of similar simulation models).},

Larval lice released from infected fish in salmon farms and their transport by water masses results in inter-farm networks of lice dispersal. Understanding this parasite connectivity is key to its control and effective management. Objectives Quantify the spatial and seasonal patterns in sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) dispersal in an area with intensive salmon farming. Identify emergent clusters in the network, where associated salmon farms could be used for coordinated management and spatial planning of the industry. Methods We used a biophysical model to simulate lice dispersal from 537 salmon farms along the Norwegian coastline for two seasons (spring and winter) from 2009 to 2014. We used network analysis to characterize dispersal pathways and quantify the spatial and temporal patterns in connectivity. Results Lice dispersal patterns and network metrics varied greatly between seasons, but differences were consistent amongst years. Winter networks presented more connections, and links were on average two times longer (average winter median = 36.5 ± 7.6 km, mean ± SE; average spring median = 17.8 ± 1.7 km). We identified 12 emergent farm clusters, which were similar across seasons and with the production areas for salmon aquaculture proposed by the Norwegian government. Conclusions Seasonal variations in lice develop-ment times, oceanographic processes and the topo-logical arrangement of salmon farms affect lice dispersal patterns. We have identified a biologically meaningful and politically tractable alliance structure for sea lice management consisting of closely-associ-ated clusters of farms.},

This is particularly true for biodiversity hotpots and ecologically sensitive areas that are subject to significant impacts from human activities. Here, we have developed an innovative approach to quantify ecological-institutional alignment across an environmentally and politically complex large-scale marine social-ecological system. We mapped the trans-boundary networks of marine population dispersal corridors, and intersected these with estimates of cross-country institutional linkages related to marine management and conservation. In integrating large-scale ecological-institutional networks, we identify geopolitical fit and misfit between a region's ecological processes and its governance. We have demonstrated this approach in the Indo-West Pacific region, a global marine biodiversity hotpot in the Indo-West Pacific. We present region-specific institutional and ecological networks, highlight current challenges, and suggest future directions to refine the proposed approach to quantify alignment between ecological processes and governance arrangements. Ultimately, our method has the potential to assist management efforts in prioritizing and strengthening governance to effectively safeguard ecological processes across multiple jurisdictions.},

Differences in species compositional turnover among sites (b diversity) occurring along gradients are often used to infer variation in the processes structuring communities. Here, we show that sampling alone predicts changes in b diversity caused simply by changes in the sizes of species pools. For example, forest inventories sampled along latitudinal and elevational gradients show the well-documented pattern that b diversity is higher in the tropics and at low elevations. However, after correcting for variation in pooled species richness (g diversity), these differences in b diversity disappear. Therefore, there is no need to invoke differences in the mechanisms of community assembly in temperate versus tropical systems to explain these global-scale patterns of b diversity.},

Conservation of seagrass requires identification of the main pressures contributing to loss and the regions most at risk of ongoing loss. Here, we model trajectories of seagrass change at the global scale and show they are related to multiple anthropogenic pressures but that trajectories vary widely with seagrass life-history strategies. Rapidly declining trajectories of seagrass meadow extent ({\textgreater}25{\%} loss from 2000 to 2010) were most strongly associated with high pressures from destructive demersal fishing and poor water quality. Conversely, seagrass meadow extent was more likely to be increasing when these two pressures were low. Meadows dominated by seagrasses with persistent life-history strategies tended to have slowly changing or stable trajectories, while those with opportunistic species were more variable, with a higher probability of either rapidly declining or rapidly increasing. Global predictions of regions most at risk for decline show high-risk areas in Europe, North America, Japan, and southeast Asia, including places where comprehensive long-term monitoring data are lacking. Our results highlight where seagrass loss may be occurring unnoticed and where urgent conservation interventions are required to reverse loss and sustain their essential services.},

abstract = {Connectivity among individual marine protected areas (MPAs) is one of the most important considerations in the design of integrated MPA networks. To provide such information for managers in Hawaii, USA, a numerical circulation model was developed to determine the role of ocean currents in transporting coral larvae from natal reefs throughout the high volcanic islands of the Maui Nui island complex in the southeastern Hawaiian Archipelago. Spatially- and temporally-varying wind, wave, and circulation model outputs were used to drive a km-scale, 3-dimensional, physics-based circulation model for Maui Nui. The model was calibrated and validated using satellite-tracked ocean surface current drifters deployed during coral-spawning conditions, then used to simulate the movement of the larvae of the dominant reef-building coral, Porites compressa, from 17 reefs during 8 spawning events in 2010-2013. These simulations make it possible to investigate not only the general dispersal patterns from individual coral reefs, but also how anomalous conditions during individual spawning events can result in large deviations from those general patterns. These data also help identify those reefs that are dominated by self-seeding and those where self-seeding is limited to determine their relative susceptibility to stressors and potential roadblocks to recovery. Overall, the numerical model results indicate that many of the coral reefs in Maui Nui seed reefs on adjacent islands, demonstrating the interconnected nature of the coral reefs in Maui Nui and providing a key component of the scientific underpinning essential for the design of a mutually supportive network of MPAs to enhance conservation of coral reefs.},

We developed an optimization approach to prioritize the maximal protection of species' ranges, ecosystem types, and forest carbon stocks, while also including habitat connectivity for range-shifting species and dispersal corridors to link protected area. We applied our approach to Sabah, Malaysia, where the state government mandated an increase in protected-area coverage of approximately 305,000 ha but did not specify where new protected areas should be. Compared with a conservation planning approach that did not incorporate the 2 connectivity features, our approach increased the protection of dispersal corridors and elevational connectivity by 13{\%} and 21{\%}, respectively. Coverage of vertebrate and plant species' ranges and forest types were the same whether connectivity was included or excluded. Our approach protected 2{\%} less forest carbon and 3{\%} less butterfly range than when connectivity features were not included. Hence, the inclusion of connectivity into conservation planning can generate large increases in the protection of landscape connectivity with minimal loss of representation of other conservation targets.},

abstract = {Seagrasses are valuable sources of food and habitat for marine life and are one of Earth's most efficient carbon sinks. However, they are facing a global decline due to ocean warming and eutrophication. In the last decade, with the advent of new technology and molecular advances, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of studies focusing on the effects of ocean warming on seagrasses. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the future of seagrasses in an era of ocean warming. We have gathered information from published studies to identify potential commonalities in the effects of warming and the responses of seagrasses across four distinct levels: molecular, biochemical/physiological, morphological/population, and ecosystem/planetary. To date, we know that although warming strongly affects seagrasses at all four levels, seagrass responses diverge amongst species, populations, and over depths. Furthermore, warming alters seagrass distribution causing massive die-offs in some seagrass populations, whilst also causing tropicalization and migration of temperate species. In this review, we evaluate the combined effects of ocean warming with other environmental stressors and emphasize the need for multiple-stressor studies to provide a deeper understanding of seagrass resilience. We conclude by discussing the most significant knowledge gaps and future directions for seagrass research.},

Persistence is well understood in theory but has proved challenging to test empirically for marine and other species with high connectivity that precludes classic colonisation–extinction dynamics. Here, we assessed persistence for a yellowtail anemonefish (Amphiprion clarkii) metapopulation using 7 years of annual sampling data along 30 km of coastline. We carefully accounted for uncertainty in demographic rates. Despite stable population abundances through time and sufficient production of surviving offspring for replacement, the pattern of connectivity made the metapopulation unlikely to persist in isolation and reliant on immigrants from outside habitat. To persist in isolation, the metapopulation would need higher fecundity or to retain essentially all recruits produced. This assessment of persistence in a marine metapopulation shows that stable abundance alone does not indicate persistence, emphasising the necessity of assessing both demographic and connectivity processes to understand metapopulation dynamics.},

abstract = {Aim We develop the first global model of connectivity for a generic broadcast spawning coral, and compare the results to connectivity estimates from genetic studies, general biogeographic patterns and theories. We also derive various ‘connectivity indices' describing relative isolation and source potential between locations. Location Modelled oceans 47° S–47° N. Methods Dispersal of model coral ‘larvae' was simulated over 8 years using an individual-based biophysical dispersal model driven by 1/12°-resolution surface ocean current data and incorporating individual trait variability (e.g. a phased pre-competency period). Source and arrival locations of modelled larvae on suitable reef habitat gave standardized dispersal paths and relative levels of connectivity. Results In the model c. 50{\%} of connections occurred within 50–100 km, with rarer dispersal between regions linking entire oceans in a ‘stepping stone' fashion. The central Pacific was an almost complete barrier to dispersal, only rarely breached westward from the Galapagos to Marquesas Islands. Areas showing strong isolation also included Hawaii, Easter Island, the Red Sea and the eastern Atlantic. The Indo-West Pacific and Great Barrier Reef showed the highest levels of connectivity, with secondary peaks in the western Indian Ocean, corresponding to areas of enriched coral diversity. The central Indo-Pacific diversity hotspot was overall a greater source than sink for dispersal. Conclusions This study provides a global view of connectivity that complements genetic and biogeographic work as well as providing a number of novel findings relevant to biogeographic theories (e.g. the central Indo-Pacific as a dispersal source; Johnston Atoll as the sole ‘stepping-stone' into Hawaii). Discrepancies with proposed connectivity patterns (e.g. one-way, westward, connectivity across the central Pacific) present hypotheses for future research. The model represents an effective tool for exploring the factors controlling connectivity on this scale and the effects of climate change on future connectivity, and will also aid predictions of future reef distributions.},

abstract = {Understanding which species and ecosystems will be most severely affected by warming as climate change advances is important for guiding conservation and management. Both marine and terrestrial fauna have been affected by warming1,2 but an explicit comparison of physiological sensitivity between the marine and terrestrial realms has been lacking. Assessing how close populations live to their upper thermal limits has been challenging, in part because extreme temperatures frequently drive demographic responses3,4 and yet fauna can use local thermal refugia to avoid extremes5–7. Here we show that marine ectotherms experience hourly body temperatures that are closer to their upper thermal limits than do terrestrial ectotherms across all latitudes—but that this is the case only if terrestrial species can access thermal refugia. Although not a direct prediction of population decline, this thermal safety margin provides an index of the physiological stress caused by warming. On land, the smallest thermal safety margins were found for species at mid-latitudes where the hottest hourly body temperatures occurred; by contrast, the marine species with the smallest thermal safety margins were found near the equator. We also found that local extirpations related to warming have been twice as common in the ocean as on land, which is consistent with the smaller thermal safety margins at sea. Our results suggest that different processes will exacerbate thermal vulnerability across these two realms. Higher sensitivities to warming and faster rates of colonization in the marine realm suggest that extirpations will be more frequent and species turnover faster in the ocean. By contrast, terrestrial species appear to be more vulnerable to loss of access to thermal refugia, which would make habitat fragmentation and changes in land use critical drivers of species loss on land.},

The surface drift is found to be seasonally variable, with stronger dispersion and outflows in the spring and fall, and negligible outflow in the summer. Dispersion at time scales less than 10 hr is well described by fractional Brownian motion, where the drifter tracks exhibit fractal characteristics with a dimension of 1.34 over scales of 2 to 13 km. Drifters are found to reach less energetic nearshore regions within 12–15 hr, which slows along-channel dispersion. The comparison of the drifter statistics (from 2014–2016) with observations of the spatial distribution of oil sheen following an oil spill in 2006 shows that the drifter results provide a reasonable proxy for oil drift in this area. A statistical model for the extent of along-channel transport of spilled oil is proposed for use in planning emergency response activities in the area.},

Underwater videography and intertidal surveys were used to map the distribution and abundance of Z. marina beds and Beggiatoa in the nearshore area of Commencement Bay, WA (USA), a location that has a long history of sawmill activity.

Areas with high sulfide levels ({\textgreater} 200 mu m) occurred where there were significant amounts of organic material in the sediments, which was found to be wood waste that had been discarded from sawmills. Zostera marina was absent from the intertidal and occurred at lower densities in areas with! high sulfide levels. In contrast, mats of Beggiatoa were only found in areas where the sulfide levels were {\textgreater} 1000 mu M and there were significant deposits of wood. Thus, the negative correlation between the distribution and abundance of Z. marina and Beggiatoa suggests that the presence of Beggiatoa mats could be used as a biological indicator of inhibiting levels of hydrogen sulfide in the marine environment.},

Considering how species differ in their propensity to move within and between MPAs is therefore a key consideration for multi-species MPA network design. Here, we propose a conceptual framework to incorporate ecological processes that affect movement at multiple life stages into the MPA network design process. We illustrate how our framework can be implemented using a set of hypothetical species that represent regional trait diversity in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We focused on two ecological processes: (1) dispersal during the larval phase and (2) daily home range movement during the adult phase. To identify functional connectivity patterns, we used a biophysical model to simulate larval dispersal, and then prioritized highly-connected patches using a reserve selection algorithm. To ensure that individual reserves were commensurate with home ranges, we also imposed reserve size constraints. Candidate areas for protection were identified based on multi-species connectivity patterns and home range size constraints. Collectively, this conceptual framework offers a flexible approach to multi-species, cross-life stage conservation planning, which can be further adapted to address complex life histories. As marine conservation efforts around the globe aim to design ecologically connected networks of protected areas, the integration of movement and connectivity data throughout ontogeny will be a key component of effective multi-species MPA network design.},

These characteristics helped determine each species' status as a distinct population segment (DPS) under the US Endangered Species Act. Here, we explore larval dispersal patterns and test whether these patterns could explain the differences in population structure. We used a 3-D oceanographic model to simulate dispersal of each species' larvae from sites inside and outside PSGB for up to 120 d. Dispersal patterns were similar across species and site-specific. Most larvae were found in the same DPS region or management basin from which they were released, but dispersal across boundaries was greatest from release sites nearest the DPS boundary for both species. Dispersal of larvae into the DPS from release sites outside the DPS increased and retention of larvae within the DPS increased with increasing pelagic larval duration, but this was also influenced by a simulated ontogenetic shift in larval depth distribution. The proportion of cross boundary dispersal observed for both species was likely high enough by Day 90 to allow gene flow across boundaries, which is consistent with the lack of population structure observed in canary rockfish but conflicts with the differentiated population structure observed in yelloweye rockfish. Understanding the potential larval dispersal pathways within and across management boundaries is an important step in the successful spatial management and recovery of important and protected species. },

We also highlight how trait-based approaches and adaptive modeling can leverage sparse data to make broader predictions. We outline a global effort to collect the data necessary to better understand, anticipate, and reduce the damaging effects of climate change on biodiversity.},

However, this theoretical result has remained untested until now. We used an experimental microarthropod metapopulation to test the effect of modularity on the response to perturbation. We perturbed one local population and measured the spread of the impact of this perturbation, both within and between modules. Our results show the buffering capacity of modular networks. To assess the generality of our findings, we then analyzed a dynamical model of our system. We show that in the absence of perturbations, modularity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size. However, even when a small local perturbation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that protects the majority of the nodes from the perturbation.},

(eelgrass) from eight locations in the San Juan Archipelago, located in the northwest corner of Washington, USA. Only 117 of the 365 samples collected were unique individuals, and there were large differences in the estimates of clonality among sites. Site-specific genotypic richness ranged from 0.082 to 0.688, and the distribution of ramets and genets varied widely within sites. No multilocus genotypes were shared between sites. We found significant differences in distribution of alleles and variance in allele frequencies among sites, suggesting substantial genetic population substructuring. We detected low levels of genetic diversity in two sites known to have undergone recent declines and a genetic signature of population expansion in a site known to be increasing. Thus, like elsewhere, we find that genetic studies add an important component to monitoring programs in this region.},

abstract = {Seagrasses comprise some of the most heterogeneous landscape structures of shallow-water estuarine/marine ecosystems in the world. How- ever, while knowledge at the molecular, organism, patch and community scale is pervasive, understanding of seagrass landscape ecology is more fragmentary and has not been synthesized. The growth and recruitment dynamics of seagrasses as well as man-made and/or natural disturbances create complex spatial configurations of seagrass over broad (metres to kilometres) spatial scales. Hence, it is important to identify mechanisms maintaining and/or threatening the diversity-promoting function of seagrass meadows and to understand their effects on benthic populations and communities. Although landscape ecology has recently become more integrated into seagrass research, our understanding of animal responses to variability in seagrass landscape structure is still fragmentary. By reviewing the literature to date, this paper evaluates studies on seagrass land- scape ecology, testing the general null hypothesis that concepts developed in terrestrial settings can be generalized across landscapes, and (a) presenting definitions and terms used in seagrass landscape ecology, (b) reviewing geographical patterns of seagrass landscape studies to identify possible key regions and target species, (c) evaluating different methodological approaches, (d) describing the spatial and temporal scales used to describe organism responses to seagrass landscape structure, and (e) placing seagrass landscapes into an applied context.  2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Marine species in the Indo-Pacific have ranges that can span thousands of kilometres, yet studies increasingly suggest that mean larval dispersal distances are less than historically assumed. Gene flow across these ranges must therefore rely to some extent on larval dispersal among intermediate 'stepping-stone' populations in combination with long-distance dispersal far beyond the mean of the dispersal kernel. We evaluate the strength of stepping-stone dynamics by employing a spatially explicit biophysical model of larval dispersal in the tropical Pacific to construct hypotheses for dispersal pathways. We evaluate these hypotheses with coalescent models of gene flow among high-island archipelagos in four neritid gastropod species. Two of the species live in the marine intertidal, while the other two are amphidromous, living in fresh water but retaining pelagic dispersal. Dispersal pathways predicted by the biophysical model were strongly favoured in 16 of 18 tests against alternate hypotheses. In regions where connectivity among high-island archipelagos was predicted as direct, there was no difference in gene flow between marine and amphidromous species. In regions where connectivity was predicted through stepping-stone atolls only accessible to marine species, gene flow estimates between high-island archipelagos were significantly higher in marine species. Moreover, one of the marine species showed a significant pattern of isolation by distance consistent with stepping-stone dynamics. While our results support stepping-stone dynamics in Indo-Pacific species, we also see evidence for nonequilibrium processes such as range expansions or rare long-distance dispersal events. This study couples population genetic and biophysical models to help to shed light on larval dispersal pathways.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms.

Fetch length and direction, measured by geographic information system-based methods, are used along with wind direction and wind speed data to estimate wave height and period by applying forecasting curves. The apparent power of waves approaching the shore, used as a proxy for wave exposure, is then calculated by a linear wave model. We demonstrate our method by calculating fetch lengths and wave exposure indices for five areas with varying exposure levels and types of meteorological conditions in the Finnish Archipelago Sea, situated in the northern Baltic Sea. This method is a rapid and accurate means of estimating exposure, and is especially applicable in areas with geomorphologically varying and complicated shorelines. We expect that our method will be useful in several fields, such as basic biogeographical and biodiversity research, as well as coastal land-use planning and management. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Ground truth surveys confirmed that, as predicted, algal canopy height increases with distance from reef edges. A grazing assay subsequently demonstrated that herbivore grazing was responsible for this pattern. In conjunction with recent behavioural ecology studies, these findings demonstrate that herbivores' collective antipredator behavioural patterns can shape vegetation distributions on a scale clearly visible from space. By using sequential Google Earth images of specific locations over time, this technique could potentially allow rapid, inexpensive remote monitoring of cascading, indirect effects of predator removals (e.g., fishing; hunting) and/or recovery and reintroductions (e.g., marine or terrestrial reserves) nearly anywhere on earth.},

Here we used a multi-scale biophysical modeling framework, the Connectivity Modeling System, for the analysis of net- work connectivity for 5 Caribbean coral reef-associ- ated species in order to gauge similarities and dissimi- larities among species as well as among Caribbean regions. We estimated local dispersal and retention to assess regional exchanges, and our results revealed that the population structures of coral and fish are dif- ferent and should thus have dissimilar management requirements in many regions, with some notable ex- ceptions. Populations of Porites astreoides corals ap- pear fragmented, suggesting that loss of adult colonies in any region may significantly impact regional re- cruitment success and connectivity. At the other end of the spectrum, populations of bluehead wrasse Tha- lassoma bifasciatum are highly connected, and re- moval of adults in any single region would not imply future recruitment failure in that region. We suggest using a ‘diversity of exogenous settlement' index as a proxy of recolonization potential, which is related to the stability of regional connectivity networks. We demonstrate that resolving multispecies larval trans- port dynamics helps identify regions of both network stability for multi-generational connectivity (e.g. sta- ble larval sources and corridors) pertinent to regional- level management and network inconsistencies among species which are pertinent to the success of local management.},

abstract = {Marine reserves are widely used to manage for the potentially conflicting objectives of conserving biodiversity and improving fisheries. The fisheries and conservation benefits of alternative reserve designs would ideally be assessed using dynamic models, which consider spillover of fish and larvae to fished areas, and the displacement of fishers to unprotected sites. In practice, however, decisions about the location of marine reserves generally rely on cheaper and faster static models. Static models analyze only spatial patterns in habitats, and typically assume fisheries profits are reduced by the amount that was generated in areas designated as reserves. To help determine the benefits of developing dynamic fisheries models, we assessed how well static models estimate costs of reserve systems to fisheries and how outcomes from reserves designed using either static or dynamic models differ. We tested these questions in two case studies, the network of marine protected areas in southern California, USA and the proposed Tun Mustapha Marine Park in Malaysia. Static models could either under or over-estimate the cost of reserve plans to fisheries, depending on the relative importance of fisher movement and larval dispersal dynamics. Despite the inaccuracy of static models for estimating costs, reserves designed using static models were similar to those designed with dynamic models if fisheries were well managed; or larval dispersal networks were simple. If larval networks were complex or there was overfishing, dynamic models generated substantially different reserve networks from static models, which improved conservation outcomes by up to 10{\%} and fishing profits by up 20{\%}. The time-scale of management was also important, because only dynamic models accounted for larval dispersal, so could find reserves that maximized the long-term benefits of larval spillover. Our case studies provide quantitative support for the assertion that static models can be useful for planning marine reserves for short-term objectives in well managed fisheries, but are not reliable for evaluating the relative costs of reserves to fisheries.},

However, while many studies have described epifaunal community properties at small spatial scales (1–10 m2) and across very large gradients (from continental coastlines to the entire globe), few have examined regional-scale (100–1000 km2) patterns or, more importantly, disentangled the drivers of these patterns. Here, we synoptically sampled the epifaunal invertebrates of 16 sites dominated by eelgrass (Zostera marina) across the lower Chesapeake Bay estuary to describe differences in epifaunal community abundance, biomass, richness, and composition. We then used complementary spatial and environmental data to identify potential drivers of these patterns. We found no significant associations between any variable and epifaunal abundance or biomass, but differences in epifaunal species richness correlated most strongly with water temperature, and differences in community composition were best explained by seagrass cover and the biomass of algal resources. Further exploration revealed the relationship between cover and community structure was driven by three specific species of peracarid crustaceans. Furthermore, when only species with direct development were included in the analysis, geographic distance, rather than seagrass cover, became a significant predictor of community composition, suggesting that species with particular traits (i.e., direct developers) are more likely to be found closer together in space.},

abstract = {The amphipods of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) habitats near Beaufort N.C., were studied with the aims of 1. 1) determining the seasonal and spatial patterns of abundance and diversity of amphipods, 2. 2) evaluating the hypothesis that predation is generating observed patterns, and 3. 3) examining the hypothesis that competition among amphipods in eelgrass systems should be relatively unimportant. Four measures of amphipod community structure examined - density, number of species per sample, diversity (H'), and evenness (J) - showed basically similar seasonal patterns. These measures are at their highest values during the late winter and decrease sharply during the spring months to summer lows. There are increases in all of them in the fall. Seasonal patterns are generally similar from year to year and are somewhat similar within a single year at two study sites located in different areas of the cstuarine system. Predator inclusion experiments using the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides (L.) were successful in generating significant reductions in amphipod abundances following the two-week duration of the experiment. On the other hand, fish exclusion experiments were mostly unsuccessful at generating significant increases in amphipod density and species diversity as compared with uncaged controls, due to an increased activity of decapod predators. The importance of competitive interactions was evaluated in three ways: 1. 1) the matrix of product moment correlation coefficients was generated for all common species from all available sample data and was examined for significant negative values, 2. 2) gut contents of five common species were examined for food overlap, and 3. 3) laboratory competition experiments were carried out with three of the more common amphipod species. Evidence for competition was slight. In the amphipod assemblage studied, there is no competitive dominant which monopolizes food or space at high densities. Increased predation pressure results in a pattern of monotonic decrease in abundance and diversity. Removal of one level of predator (fish) in this system appears to result in increases in other predatory levels (decapod crustaceans), thus continuing to keep amphipod abundances low. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

This situation is primarily due to lack of comprehensive, sufficiently long-term, and spatially extensive datasets. Seagrasses, which provide nursery habitat, improve water quality, and constitute a globally important carbon sink, are among the most vulnerable habitats on the planet. Here, we unite 31 years of high-resolution aerial monitoring and water quality data to elucidate the patterns and drivers of eelgrass (Zostera marina) abundance in Chesapeake Bay, USA, one of the largest and most valuable estuaries in the world, with an unparalleled history of regulatory efforts. We show that eelgrass area has declined 29{\%} in total since 1991, with wide-ranging and severe ecological and economic consequences. We go on to identify an interaction between decreasing water clarity and warming temperatures as the primary drivers of this trend. Declining clarity has gradually reduced eelgrass cover the past two decades, primarily in deeper beds where light is already limiting. In shallow beds, however, reduced visibility exacerbates the physiological stress of acute warming, leading to recent instances of decline approaching 80{\%}. While degraded water quality has long been known to influence underwater grasses worldwide, we demonstrate a clear and rapidly emerging interaction with climate change. We highlight the urgent need to integrate a broader perspective into local water quality management, in the Chesapeake Bay and in the many other coastal systems facing similar stressors.},

Otolith microstructure analysis revealed that larvae were 14–17 days old and that spawning occurred in June and July. A biophysical dispersal model was used to backtrack larvae to their potential spawning locations and results indicated that spawning occurred in the southern Gulf of Mexico near the Yucat{\'{a}}n Peninsula, suggesting that these larvae may have been transported into the northern Gulf of Mexico by the Loop Current. Here we provide useful information for identifying lionfish larvae and offer insight into lionfish spawning and larval dispersal pathways.},

The significant role seagrass meadows play in supporting fisheries productivity and food security across the globe is not adequately reflected in the decisions made by authorities with statutory responsibility for their management. We provide a unique global analysis of three data sources to present the case for why seagrass meadows need targeted policy to recognize and protect their role in supporting fisheries production and food security. (1) Seagrass meadows provide valuable nursery habitat to over 1/5th of the world's largest 25 fisheries, including Walleye Pollock, the most landed species on the planet. (2) In complex small-scale fisheries from around the world (poorly represented in fisheries statistics), we present evidence that many of those in proximity to seagrass are supported to a large degree by these habitats. (3) We reveal how intertidal fishing activity in seagrass is a global phenomenon, often directly supporting human livelihoods. Our study demonstrates that seagrasses should be recognized and managed to maintain and maximize their role in global fisheries production. The chasm that exists between coastal habitat conservation and fisheries management needs to be filled to maximize the chances of seagrass meadows supporting fisheries, so that they can continue to support human wellbeing.},

Here, we synthesized all available studies of the consistency of marine ecological observations with expectations under climate change. This yielded a meta- database of 1,735 marine biological responses for which either regional or global climate change was considered as a driver. Included were instances of marine taxa responding as expected, in a manner inconsistent with expectations, and taxa demonstrating no response. From this database, 81–83{\%} of all observations for distribution, phenology, community composition, abundance, demography and calcification across taxa and ocean basins were consistent with the expected impacts of climate change. Of the species responding to climate change, rates of distribution shiftswere, on average, consistent with those required to track ocean surface temperature changes. Conversely, we did not find a relationship between regional shifts in spring phenology and the seasonality of temperature. Rates of observed shifts in species' distributions and phenology are comparable to, or greater, than those for terrestrial systems.},

In reality, ecological linkages between sites are rarely symmetric and often strongly asymmetric.

We illustrate this approach using hypothetical exam- ples of a river catchment and a group of reefs, and then apply it to case studies in the Snowy River catchment and Great Barrier Reef, Australia.We show that incorporating asymmetric ecological connectivity in systematic reserve design leads to solutions that more effectively capture connectivity patterns, relative to either ignoring connectivity or assuming symmetric connectivity.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Dispersal provides a key mechanism for geographical range shifts in response to changing environmental conditions. For mangroves, which are highly susceptible to climate change, the spatial scale of dispersal remains largely unknown. Here we use a high-resolution, eddy- and tide-resolving numerical ocean model to simulate mangrove propagule dispersal across the global ocean and generate connectivity matrices between mangrove habitats using a range of floating periods. We find high rates of along-coast transport and transoceanic dispersal across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. No connectivity is observed between populations on either side of the American and African continents. Archipelagos, such as the Galapagos and those found in Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia, act as critical stepping-stones for dispersal across the Pacific Ocean. Direct and reciprocal dispersal routes across the Indian Ocean via the South Equatorial Current and seasonally reversing monsoon currents, respectively, allow connectivity between western Indian Ocean and Indo-West Pacific sites. We demonstrate the isolation of the Hawaii Islands and help explain the presence of mangroves on the latitudinal outlier Bermuda. Finally, we find that dispersal distance and connectivity are highly sensitive to the minimum and maximum floating periods. We anticipate that our findings will guide future research agendas to quantify biophysical factors that determine mangrove dispersal and connectivity, including the influence of ocean surface water properties on metabolic processes and buoyancy behavior, which may determine the potential of viably reaching a suitable habitat. Ultimately, this will lead to a better understanding of global mangrove species distributions and their response to changing climate conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The concept of centrality is often invoked in social network analysis, and diverse indices have been proposed to measure it. This paper develops a unified framework for the measurement of centrality. All measures of centrality assess a node's involvement in the walk structure of a network. Measures vary along four key dimensions: type of nodal involvement assessed, type of walk considered, property of walk assessed, and choice of summary measure. If we cross-classify measures by type of nodal involvement (radial versus medial) and property of walk assessed (volume versus length), we obtain a four-fold polychotomization with one cell empty which mirrors Freeman's 1979 categorization. At a more substantive level, measures of centrality summarize a node's involvement in or contribution to the cohesiveness of the network. Radial measures in particular are reductions of pair-wise proximities/cohesion to attributes of nodes or actors. The usefulness and interpretability of radial measures depend on the fit of the cohesion matrix to the one-dimensional model. In network terms, a network that is fit by a one-dimensional model has a core-periphery structure in which all nodes revolve more or less closely around a single core. This in turn implies that the network does not contain distinct cohesive subgroups. Thus, centrality is shown to be intimately connected with the cohesive subgroup structure of a network. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The precarious state of many nearshore marine ecosystems has prompted the use of marine protected areas as a tool for management and conservation. However, there remains substantial debate over their design and, in particular, how to best account for the spatial dynamics of nearshore marine species. Many commercially important nearshore marine species are sedentary as adults, with limited home ranges. It is as larvae that they disperse greater distances, traveling with ocean currents sometimes hundreds of kilometers. As a result, these species exist in spatially complex systems of connected subpopulations. Here, we explicitly account for the mutual dependence of subpopulations and approach protected area design in terms of network robustness. Our goal is to characterize the topology of nearshore metapopulation networks and their response to perturbation, and to identify critical subpopulations whose protection would reduce the risk for stock collapse. We define metapopulation networks using realistic estimates of larval dispersal generated from ocean circulation simulations and spatially explicit metapopulation models, and we then explore their robustness using node-removal simulation experiments. Nearshore metapopulations show small-world network properties, and we identify a set of highly connected hub subpopulations whose removal maximally disrupts the metapopulation network. Protecting these subpopulations reduces the risk for systemic failure and stock collapse. Our focus on catastrophe avoidance provides a unique perspective for spatial marine planning and the design of marine protected areas.},

abstract = {Shoreline armoring is widespread in many parts of the protected inland waters of the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A, but impacts on physical and biological features of local nearshore ecosystems have only recently begun to be documented. Armoring marine shorelines can alter natural processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales; some, such as starving the beach of sediments by blocking input from upland bluffs may take decades to become visible, while others such as placement loss of armoring construction are immediate. We quantified a range of geomorphic and biological parameters at paired, nearby armored and unarmored beaches throughout the inland waters of Washington State to test what conditions and parameters are associated with armoring. We gathered identical datasets at a total of 65 pairs of beaches: 6 in South Puget Sound, 23 in Central Puget Sound, and 36 pairs North of Puget Sound proper. At this broad scale, demonstrating differences attributable to armoring is challenging given the high natural variability in measured parameters among beaches and regions. However, we found that armoring was consistently associated with reductions in beach width, riparian vegetation, numbers of accumulated logs, and amounts and types of beach wrack and associated invertebrates. Armoring-related patterns at lower beach elevations (further vertically from armoring) were progressively harder to detect. For some parameters, such as accumulated logs, there was a distinct threshold in armoring elevation that was associated with increased impacts. This large dataset for the first time allowed us to identify cumulative impacts that appear when increasing proportions of shorelines are armored. At large spatial and temporal scales, armoring much of a sediment drift cell may result in reduction of the finer grain-size fractions on beaches, including those used by spawning forage fish. Overall we have shown that local impacts of shoreline armoring can scale-up to have cumulative and threshold effects -- these should be considered when managing impacts to public resources along the coast.},

abstract = {Spatial connectivity is an essential process to consider in the design and assessment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). To help maintain and restore marine populations and communities MPAs should form ecologically coherent networks. How to estimate and implement connectivity in MPA design remains a challenge. Here a new theoretical framework is presented based on biophysical modelling of organism dispersal, combined with a suite of tools to assess different aspects of connectivity that can be integrated in MPA design. As a demonstration, these tools are applied to an MPA network in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM MPA). The tools are based on the connectivity matrix, which summarizes dispersal probabilities, averaged over many years, between all considered areas in the geographic target area. The biophysical model used to estimate connectivity included important biological traits that affect dispersal patterns where different trait combinations and habitat preferences will produce specific connectivity matrices representing different species. Modelled connectivity matrices were used to assess local retention within individual MPAs, which offers indications about the adequacy of size when MPAs are considered in isolation. The connectivity matrix also provides information about source areas to individual MPAs, e.g. sources of larvae or pressures such as contaminants. How well several MPAs act as a network was assessed within a framework of eigenvalue perturbation theory (EPT). With EPT, the optimal MPA network with respect to connectivity can be identified. In addition, EPT can suggest optimal extensions of existing MPA networks to enhance connectivity. Finally, dispersal barriers can be identified based on the connectivity matrix, which may suggest boundaries for management units. The assessment of connectivity for the HELCOM MPA are discussed in terms of possible improvements, but the tools presented here could be applied to any region.},

To examine regime shifts and the management actions that can influence this phenomenon we present a conceptual model of resilience in seagrass ecosystems. The model is founded on a series of features and modifiers that act as interacting influences upon seagrass ecosystem resilience. Improved understanding and appreciation of the factors and modifiers that govern resilience in seagrass ecosystems can be utilised to support much needed evidence based management of a vital natural resource.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are the cornerstone of most marine conservation strategies, but the effectiveness of each one partly depends on its size and distance to other MPAs in a network. Despite this, current recommendations on ideal MPA size and spacing vary widely, and data are lacking on how these constraints might influence the overall spatial characteristics, socio-economic impacts, and connectivity of the resultant MPA networks. To address this problem, we tested the impact of applying different MPA size constraints in English waters. We used the Marxan spatial prioritization software to identify a network of MPAs that met conservation feature targets, whilst minimizing impacts on fisheries; modified the Marxan outputs with the MinPatch software to ensure each MPA met a minimum size; and used existing data on the dispersal distances of a range of species found in English waters to investigate the likely impacts of such spatial constraints on the region's biodiversity. Increasing MPA size had little effect on total network area or the location of priority areas, but as MPA size increased, fishing opportunity cost to stakeholders increased. In addition, as MPA size increased, the number of closely connected sets of MPAs in networks and the average distance between neighboring MPAs decreased, which consequently increased the proportion of the planning region that was isolated from all MPAs. These results suggest networks containing large MPAs would be more viable for the majority of the region's species that have small dispersal distances, but dispersal between MPA sets and spill-over of individuals into unprotected areas would be reduced. These findings highlight the importance of testing the impact of applying different MPA size constraints because there are clear trade-offs that result from the interaction of size, number, and distribution of MPAs in a network.},

abstract = {Systematic conservation planning (SCP) has increasingly been used to prioritize conservation actions, including the design of new protected areas to achieve conservation objectives. Over the last 10 years, the number of marine SCP studies has increased exponentially, yet there is no structured or reliable way to find information on methods, trends, and progress. The rapid growth in methods and marine applications warrants an updated analysis of the literature, as well as reflection on the need for continuous and systematic documentation of SCP exercises in general. To address these gaps, we developed a database to document SCP exercises and populated it with 155 marine SCP exercises found in the primary literature. Based on our review, we provide an update on global advances and trends in marine SCP literature. We found accelerating growth in the number of studies over the past decade, with increasing consideration of socioeconomic variables, land-sea planning, and ecological connectivity. While several studies aimed to inform conservation decisions, we found little evidence of input from practitioners. There are important gaps in geographic coverage and little correspondence with areas most threatened. Five countries lead most studies, but their networks suggest potential for capacity building through collaborations. The varying quality and detail in documentation of studies confirmed the limited opportunities to develop and assess the application of best practice in conservation planning. A global database to track the development, implementation, and impact of SCP applications can thus provide numerous benefits. Our database constitutes an important step towards the development of a centralized repository of information on planning exercises and can serve several roles to advance SCP theory and practice: it facilitates assessing geographic coverage and gaps; scientists and practitioners can access information to identify trends in the use of data, methods, and tools; reviewers and editors of journals can assess whether studies have covered important literature and developments; donors and non-government organizations can identify regions needing further work; and practitioners and policy-makers can learn from previous plans.},

Here, we report how disturbance generated by sea otters (Enhydra lutris) digging for infaunal prey in eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows increases genetic diversity by promoting conditions for sexual reproduction of plants. Eelgrass allelic richness and genotypic diversity were, respectively, 30 and 6{\%} higher in areas where recovering sea otter populations had been established for 20 to 30 years than in areas where they had been present {\textless}10 years or absent {\textgreater}100 years. The influence of sea otter occupancy on the aforementioned measures of genetic diversity was stronger than those of depth, temperature, latitude, or meadow size. Our findings reveal an underappreciated evolutionary process by which megafauna may promote genetic diversity and ecological resilience.},

abstract = {1. Globally, protected areas are being established to protect biodiversity and to promote ecosystem resilience. The typical spatial conservation planning process leading to the creation of these protected areas focuses on representation and replication of ecological features, often using decision support systems such as Marxan. Unfortunately, Marxan currently requires manual input or specialised scripts to explicitly consider ecological connectivity, a property critical to metapopulation persistence and resilience. 2. “Marxan Connect” is a new open source, open access Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed to assist conservation planners in the systematic operationalization of ecological connectivity in protected area network planning. 3. Marxan Connect is able to incorporate estimates of demographic connectivity ( e.g. derived from tracking data, dispersal models, or genetics) or structural landscape connectivity ( e.g. isolation by resistance). This is accomplished by calculating metapopulation-relevant connectivity metrics ( e.g. eigenvector centrality) and treating those as conservation features, or using the connectivity data as a spatial dependency amongst sites to be included in the prioritization process. 4. Marxan Connect allows a wide group of users to incorporate directional ecological connectivity into conservation plans. The least-cost conservation solutions provided by Marxan Connect, combined with ecologically relevant post-hoc testing, are more likely to support persistent and resilient metapopulations ( e.g. fish stocks) and provide better protection for biodiversity than if connectivity is ignored.},

We find that for 83{\%} of the ocean, {\textgreater}25{\%} of assessed species are considered threatened, and 15{\%} of the ocean shows {\textgreater}50{\%} of assessed species threatened when weighting for range‐limited species. By comparing mean extinction risk of marine biodiversity to no‐take marine reserve placement, we identify regions where reserves preferentially afford proactive protection (i.e., preserving low‐risk areas) or reactive protection (i.e., mitigating high‐risk areas), indicating opportunities and needs for effective future protection at national and regional scales. In addition, elevated risk to high seas biodiversity highlights the need for credible protection and minimization of threatening activities in international waters.},

abstract = {Definitions: Spatial insurance: Improvement of maintenance of species diversity and ecosystem functioning in heterogeneous environments because species can track their optimal environments by dispersing between habitat patches. Betweenness centrality: Value of an individual habitat patch in adding to the connectivity of the metacommunity by being a stepping-stone for dispersing individuals. Robustness: The proportion of patches that must be removed to change each response variable beyond a given threshold. Question: In fragmented landscapes, how do spatial patterns of habitat loss affect the robustness of the insurance effects on biodiversity? Does the underlying pattern of habitat connectivity in metacommunities play a role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function in the face of habitat loss? Mathematical method: Using a spatially explicit version of a resource competition metacommunity model, we simulated habitat loss in metacommunity networks composed of habitat patches connected by links for dispersal. Key assumptions: Species differ in their environmental preferences. Local environmental conditions fluctuate asynchronously so that species must disperse in order to persist and maintain productivity. Habitat patches are lost sequentially, resulting in gradual fragmentation of the metacommunity. Results: Habitat loss reduces the amount of spatial insurance conferred by the habitat structure on biodiversity by preventing species from dispersing to environmentally suitable areas. The robustness of metacommunities to habitat loss decreases dramatically when the patches with high betweenness centrality are lost. Metacommunities are generally most robust when the pattern of habitat connectivity is random and when the habitat patches that are lost have low betweenness centrality.},

abstract = {Characterizing the response of ecosystems to global climate change requires that multiple aspects of environmental change be considered simultaneously, however, it can be difficult to describe the relative importance of environmental metrics given their collinearity. Here, we present a novel framework for disentangling the complex ecological effects of environmental variability by documenting the emergent properties of eelgrass ( Zostera marina ) ecosystems across ∼225 km of the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, representing gradients in temperature, light, sediment properties, and water motion, and evaluate the relative importance of different metrics characterizing these environmental conditions (e.g., means, extremes, variability on different time scales) for eelgrass bioindicators using lasso regression and commonality analysis. We found that eelgrass beds in areas that were warmer, shallower, and had low water motion had lower productivity and resilience relative to beds in deeper, cooler areas that were well flushed, and that higher temperatures lowered eelgrass tolerance to low-light conditions. There was significant variation in the importance of various metrics of temperature, light, and water motion across biological responses, demonstrating that different aspects of environmental change uniquely impact the cellular, physiological, and ecological processes underlying eelgrass productivity and resilience, and contribute synergistically to the observed ecosystem response. In particular, we identified the magnitude of temperature variability over daily and tidal cycles as an important determinant of eelgrass productivity. These results indicate that ecosystem responses are not fully resolved by analyses that only consider changes in mean conditions, and that the removal of collinear variables prior to analyses relating environmental metrics to biological change reduces the potential to detect important environmental effects. The framework we present can help to identify the conditions that promote high ecosystem function and resilience, which is necessary to inform nearshore conservation and management practices under global climate change.},

abstract = {Recently developing hierarchical community models {(HCMs)} accounting for incomplete sampling are promising approaches to understand community organization. However, pros and cons of incorporating incomplete sampling in the analysis and related design issues remain unknown. In this study, we compared {HCM} and canonical redundancy analysis {(RDA)} carried out with 10 different dissimilarity coefficients to evaluate how each approach restores true community abundance data sampled with imperfect detection. We conducted simulation experiments with varying numbers of sampling sites, visits, mean detectability and mean abundance. Performance of {HCM} was measured by estimates of “expected” (mean) abundance ($\lambda${$\backslash$textasciicircum}ij) and realized abundance {(N{$\backslash$textasciicircum}ij:} direct estimate of site‐ and species‐specific abundance). We also compared {HCM} and different types of {RDA} (normal, partial, and weighted), all performed with the same ten different dissimilarity coefficients, with unequal number of visits to sampling sites. In addition, we applied the models to a virtual survey carried out on the Barro Colorado Island tree plot data for which we know true community abundance. Simulation experiments showed that N{$\backslash$textasciicircum}ij yielded by {HCM} best restored the underlying abundance of constituent species among 12 abundance estimates by {HCM} and {RDA} regardless if the sampling was equal or unequal. Mean abundance predominantly affected the performance of {HCM} and {RDA} while $\lambda${$\backslash$textasciicircum}ij yielded by {HCM} had comparable performance to percentage difference and Gower dissimilarity coefficients of {RDA.} Relative performance of {RDA} types depended on the combination of dissimilarity coefficients and the distribution of sampling effort. Best performance of N{$\backslash$textasciicircum}ij followed by $\lambda${$\backslash$textasciicircum}ij, percentage difference and Gower dissimilarity were also observed for the analysis of tree plot data, and graphical plots (triplots) based on $\lambda${$\backslash$textasciicircum}ij rather than N{$\backslash$textasciicircum}ij clearly separated the effects of two environmental covariates on the abundance of constituent species. Under our conditions of model evaluation and the method, we concluded that, in terms of assessing the environmental dependence of abundance, {HCMs} and {RDA} can have comparable performance if we can choose appropriate dissimilarity coefficients for {RDA.} However, since {HCMs} provide straightforward biological interpretations of parameter estimates and flexibility of the analysis, {HCMs} would be useful in many situations as well as conventional canonical ordinations.},

abstract = {There is a pressing need to understand the consequences of human activities, such as land transformations, on watershed ecosystem services. This is a challenging task because different indicators of water quality and yield are expected to vary in their responsiveness to large versus local-scale heterogeneity in land use and land cover (LUC). Here we rely on water quality data collected between 1977 and 2000 from dozens of gauge stations in Puerto Rico together with precipitation data and land cover maps to (1) quantify impacts of spatial heterogeneity in LUC on several water quality indicators; (2) determine the spatial scale at which this heterogeneity influences water quality; and (3) examine how antecedent precipitation modulates these impacts. Our models explained 30-58{\%} of observed variance in water quality metrics. Temporal variation in antecedent precipitation and changes in LUC between measurements periods rather than spatial variation in LUC accounted for the majority of variation in water quality. Urbanization and pasture development generally degraded water quality while agriculture and secondary forest re-growth had mixed impacts. The spatial scale over which LUC influenced water quality differed across indicators. Turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) responded to LUC in large-scale watersheds, in-stream nitrogen concentrations to LUC in riparian buffers of large watersheds, and fecal matter content and in-stream phosphorus concentration to LUC at the sub-watershed scale. Stream discharge modulated impacts of LUC on water quality for most of the metrics. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple spatial scales for understanding the impacts of human activities on watershed ecosystem services. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The extent of connectivity is, therefore, predicted to also influence the outcomes of conservation initiatives, such as marine reserves. Here we review the published evidence about how important seascape connectivity (i.e. landscape connectivity in the sea) is for marine conservation outcomes. Location Global. Methods We analysed the global literature on the effects of seascape connectivity on reserve performance. Results In the majority of cases, greater seascape connectivity inside reserves translates into better conservation outcomes (i.e. enhanced productivity and diversity). Research on reserve performance is, however, most often conducted separately from research on connectivity, resulting in few studies ({\textless} 5{\%} of all studies of seascape connectivity) that have quantified how connectivity modifies reserve effects on populations, assemblages or ecosystem functioning in seascapes. Nevertheless, evidence for positive effects of connectivity on reserve performance is geographically widespread, encompassing studies in the Caribbean Sea, Florida Keys and western Pacific Ocean. Main conclusions Given that research rarely connects the effects of connectivity and reserves, our thesis is that stronger linkages between landscape ecology and marine spatial planning are likely to improve conservation outcomes in the sea. The key science challenge is to identify the full range of ecological functions that are modulated by connectivity and the spatial scale over which these functions enhance conservation outcomes},

Magnitudes are similar to local fluxes in freshwater and benthic ecosystems, but two to three orders of magnitude lower in terrestrial systems, demonstrating different dependencies on spatial flows among ecosystem types. The strong spatial couplings also indicate that ecosystems are vulnerable to alterations of cross-ecosystem flows.

abstract = {The metacommunity framework has been readily applied to coastal benthic marine environments to examine how larval dispersal affects the dynamics of patchily distributed communities. Transitioning to a meta-ecosystem perspective requires knowledge of interactions between living and non-living compartments occurring across scales in these environments. Here, we synthesize and analyze evidence of non-living resource flows in coastal benthic marine environments. Our objectives are to establish the types of benthic ecosystems that are coupled by resource flows, the spatial scale and directionality of the couplings, and the magnitude of resulting subsidization of recipient organisms. We find that resource flows commonly couple different types of coastal benthic ecosystems and can occur bidirectionally between ecosystems. Our quantitative synthesis yields a frequency distribution of resource flow distance, which suggests they frequently couple ecosystems across smaller distances than larval dispersal and that the probability of resource flows coupling benthic ecosystems decreases exponentially with distance between ecosystems. The magnitude of subsidization of recipient organisms also decreases with distance from the source of the resource flow. Our findings reveal that considering ecosystem heterogeneity and the respective scales of different types of spatial flows will be an important component of extending the marine metacommunity framework to meta-ecosystems. We propose an avenue for integrating ecosystem heterogeneity into meta-ecosystem theory, based upon general differences in functioning across coupled ecosystems revealed by our synthesis, and we argue for the development of a hierarchical meta-ecosystem theory.},

abstract = {Scientists have advocated for local interventions, such as creating marine protected areas and implementing fishery restrictions, as ways to mitigate local stressors to limit the effects of climate change on reef-building corals. However, in a literature review, we find little empirical support for the notion of managed resilience. We outline some reasons for why marine protected areas and the protection of herbivorous fish (especially parrotfish) have had little effect on coral resilience. One key explanation is that the impacts of local stressors (e.g., pollution and fishing) are often swamped by the much greater effect of ocean warming on corals. Another is the sheer complexity (including numerous context dependencies) of the five cascading links assumed by the managed-resilience hypothesis. If reefs cannot be saved by local actions alone, then it is time to face reef degradation head-on, by directly addressing anthropogenic climate change—the root cause of global coral decline.},

Discord between environmental and economic metrics creates problems in assessing trade-offs between different current or potential resource uses. Ecosystem accounts, which quantify ecosystems and their benefits for human well-being consistent with national economic accounts, provide exciting opportunities to contribute significantly to the policy process. We advanced the application of ecosystem accounts in a regional case study by explicitly and spatially linking impacts of human and natural activities on ecosystem assets and services to their associated industries. This demonstrated contributions of ecosystems beyond the traditional national accounts. Our results revealed that native forests would provide greater benefits from their ecosystem services of carbon sequestration, water yield, habitat provisioning and recreational amenity if harvesting for timber production ceased, thus allowing forests to continue growing to older ages.},

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and networks of MPAs are being implemented globally as a spatial management tool for achieving conservation objectives. There has been considerable progress in reaching the prescribed 10{\%} protected area target for 2020, outlined in the Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 11 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14. The application of MPA network design principles (e.g. Representative, ecological connectivity), which underpin ecological coherence, is still lacking or insufficient in many regions. Poor ecological coherence hinders the ecological performance of MPA networks, leading to dysfunction in the flow of ecosystem services and reduced ecosystem benefits, with potentially negative consequences for human well-being. This paper presents four pivotal focus points for future progress that can bridge the gap between ecological and social systems. The aim is to shift the discourse of ‘ecological coherence' further into the social sphere, and hence support the alignment of the process of designating ecologically coherent MPA networks with the ‘triple bottom line' of economic development, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion, as described in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to achieve social–ecological coherence in MPA network design.},

Although maintaining connectivity among habitats within a seascape is necessary for preserving population resistance and resilience, quantifying movements of individuals within seascapes remains challenging. Traditional methods of identifying and valuing potential coral reef fish nursery habitats are indirect, often relying on visual surveys of abundance and correlations of size and biomass among habitats. We used compound-specific stable isotope analyses to determine movement patterns of commercially important fish populations within a coral reef seascape. This approach allowed us to quantify the relative contributions of individuals from inshore nurseries to reef populations and identify migration corridors among important habitats. Our results provided direct measurements of remarkable migrations by juvenile snapper of over 30 km, between nurseries and reefs. We also found significant plasticity in juvenile nursery residency. Although a majority of individuals on coastal reefs had used seagrass nurseries as juveniles, many adults on oceanic reefs had settled directly into reef habitats. Moreover, seascape configuration played a critical but heretofore unrecognized role in determining connectivity among habitats. Finally, our approach provides key quantitative data necessary to estimate the value of distinctive habitats to ecosystem services provided by seascapes.},

abstract = {Studying the larval dispersal of bottom-dwelling species is necessary to understand their population dynamics and optimize their management. The black-lip pearl oyster (Pinctada margaritifera) is cultured extensively to produce black pearls, especially in French Polynesia's atoll lagoons. This aquaculture relies on spat collection, a process that can be optimized by understanding which factors influence larval dispersal. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of P. margaritifera larval dispersal kernel to both physical and biological factors in the lagoon of Ahe atoll. Specifically, using a validated 3D larval dispersal model, the variability of lagoon-scale connectivity is investigated against wind forcing, depth and location of larval release, destination location, vertical swimming behavior and pelagic larval duration (PLD) factors. The potential connectivity was spatially weighted according to both the natural and cultivated broodstock densities to provide a realistic view of connectivity. We found that the mean pattern of potential connectivity was driven by the southwest and northeast main barotropic circulation structures, with high retention levels in both. Destination locations, spawning sites and PLD were the main drivers of potential connectivity, explaining respectively 26{\%}, 59{\%} and 5{\%} of the variance. Differences between potential and realistic connectivity showed the significant contribution of the pearl oyster broodstock location to its own dynamics. Realistic connectivity showed larger larval supply in the western destination locations, which are preferentially used by farmers for spat collection. In addition, larval supply in the same sectors was enhanced during summer wind conditions. These results provide new cues to understanding the dynamics of bottom-dwelling populations in atoll lagoons, and show how to take advantage of numerical models for pearl oyster management.},

The influence of physical and biological processes and their relationship to transport and retention of early life history stages has been central in providing insight into population structuring and connectivity. However, the focus on dispersive early life history stages has meant that the role of adults has received less attention and is not fully understood or appreciated. We argue that adults play a vital role in population connectivity for a wide range of marine taxa and hypothesize that adult-mediated population connectivity commonly results in a diverse array of population structuring. Two case-studies on winter skate, Leucoraja ocellata, and winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, are presented to illustrate the role adults play in marine connectivity at both broad and fine scales, respectively. Indeed, if adults are important for population connectivity, we argue that the role of larval processes is conditional on adult choice and only management and research pursuits that integrate the full life cycle of species will capture the full dynamics of metapopulation connectivity. Failure to include the roles of adults can lead to misinterpretation of the causes and consequences of changes in ecosystem structure and fisheries productivity.},

abstract = {Connectivity is regarded globally as a guiding principle for conservation planning, but due to difficulties in quantifying connectivity, empirical data remain scarce. Lack of meaningful connectivity metrics is likely leading to inadequate representation of important biological connections in reserve networks. Identifying patterns in landscape connectivity can, theoretically, improve the design of conservation areas. We used a network model to estimate seascape connectivity for coral reef-associated fishes in a subtropical bay in Australia. The model accounted for two scales of connectivity: (i) within mosaics at a local scale and (ii) among these mosaics at a regional scale. Connections among mosaics were modelled using estimations of post-larval small and intermediate movement distances represented by home ranges of two fish species. Modelled connectivity patterns were assessed with existing data on fish diversity. For fishes with intermediate home ranges (0–6 km), connectivity [quantified by the index Probability of Connectivity (dPC)] explained 51–60{\%} of species diversity. At smaller home ranges (0–1 km), species diversity was associated closely with intramosaic connectivity quantified by the index dPCintra. Mosaics and their region-wide connections were ranked for their contribution to overall seascape connectivity and compared against current positions and boundaries of reserves. Our matching shows that only three of the 10 most important mosaics are at least partly encompassed within a reserve, and only a single important regional connection lies within a reserve. Synthesis and applications. Notwithstanding its formal recognition in reserve planning, connectivity is rarely accounted for in practice, mainly because suitable metrics of connectivity are not available in planning phases. Here, we show how a network analysis can be effectively used in conservation planning by identifying biological connectivity inside and outside present reserve networks. Our results demonstrate clearly that connectivity is insufficiently represented within a reserve network. We also provide evidence of key pathways in need of protection to avoid nullifying the benefits of protecting key reefs. The guiding principle of protecting connections among habitats can be achieved more effectively in future, by formally incorporating our findings into the decision framework.},

In both settings I found circumstantial evidence for competition for space between the two species but it is unclear who is displacing whom. Deterministic economic modeling revealed a modest cost to lobster fishers who take time to kill lionfish or work more slowly to avoid their venomous spines. However, this cost exacerbated the negative effects of variation in other components of the fishery, such as lobster price, time taken to gather lobsters, and amount harvested at each condo. This study provides the first attempt to quantify some of the economic impacts of invasive lionfish.},

Particularly among land plants, N 2 -fixing symbionts occur in a variety of distantly related plant lineages and often involve an intimate association between host and symbiont 2,4 . Descriptions of such intimate symbioses are lacking for seagrasses, which evolved around 100 million years ago from terrestrial flowering plants that migrated back to the sea 5 . Here we describe an N 2 -fixing symbiont, ‘ Candidatus Celerinatantimonas neptuna', that lives inside seagrass root tissue, where it provides ammonia and amino acids to its host in exchange for sugars. As such, this symbiosis is reminiscent of terrestrial N 2 -fixing plant symbioses. The symbiosis between Ca . C. neptuna and its host Posidonia oceanica enables highly productive seagrass meadows to thrive in the nitrogen-limited Mediterranean Sea. Relatives of Ca . C. neptuna occur worldwide in coastal ecosystems, in which they may form similar symbioses with other seagrasses and saltmarsh plants. Just like N 2 -fixing microorganisms might have aided the colonization of nitrogen-poor soils by early land plants 6 , the ancestors of Ca . C. neptuna and its relatives probably enabled flowering plants to invade nitrogen-poor marine habitats, where they formed extremely efficient blue carbon ecosystems 7 . },

I have attempted to define strong interactions in three different ecosystems. This difficult problem is confounded by the loss of natural systems resulting from human impacts. I discuss my frustrations with eroding conservation efforts in a society that is rapidly devaluing nature and consider how we might recover our most fundamental values. I conclude that there is an urgent need to improve field-based teaching of undergraduate non-majors about nature and to be much more effective in our interactions with the general public.

abstract = {Effective coastal conservation requires a better understanding of how human activities on land may directly and indirectly affect adjacent marine communities. However, the relationship between terrestrial and marine systems has rarely been considered in terrestrial and marine reserve design. Seagrasses are affected by land-based activities due to their proximity to terrestrial systems and sensitivity to fluxes of terrestrially-derived organic and inorganic material. Our study examines how land use patterns adjacent to seagrass meadows influence the ecological integrity of seagrass using a suite of seagrass condition metrics on a landscape level across the Philippine archipelago. Using canonical correlation analysis, we measured the association between environmental variables (land use and seagrass abiotic conditions) with biotic variables (seagrass species richness and abundance). Terrestrial protection adjacent to seagrass meadows, defined as the absence of various anthropogenic land use perturbations, had significant positive effects on seagrass condition. The watershed area, and area of farmland and human development, had the most negative effect on seagrass condition. Using analysis of covariance and regression, we examined how marine protected area (MPA) establishment, size, and age, affected seagrass biotic conditions while holding environmental conditions constant. The relationship between biological and environmental canonical factors did not vary as a function of an MPA. This study provides evidence that land use is more important than marine protection for tropical seagrass condition. Our results demonstrate the complementary connection between land and sea, justifying the ‘ridge-to-reef' approach in coastal conservation. Proper management of seagrasses should account for stewardship of the adjacent watersheds.},

Here, we review the evolution of the “nursery habitat hypothesis” and use {\textgreater}11,000 comparisons from 160 peer-reviewed studies to test whether and which structured habitats increase juvenile density, growth, and survival. In general, almost all structured habitats signif- icantly enhanced juvenile density—and in some cases growth and survival—relative to unstructured habitats. Underwater grasses and mangroves also promoted juvenile density and growth beyond what was observed in other structured habitats. These conclusions were robust to variation among studies, although there were significant differences with latitude and among some phyla. Our results confirm the basic nurs- ery function of certain structured habitats, which lends further support to their con- servation, restoration, and management at a time when our coastal environments are becoming increasingly impacted. They also reveal a dearth of evidence from many other systems (e.g., kelp forests) and for responses other than density. Although recent studies have advocated for increasingly complex approaches to evaluating nurseries, we recommend a renewed emphasis on more straightforward assessments of juvenile growth, survival, reproduction, and recruitment.

Here, we develop, and apply to a relevant case study, a method suited to merge Earth/field observations with spatially explicit stochastic metapopulation models to study the near-term ecological dynamics of target species in complex terrains. Our framework incorporates the use of species distribution models for a reasoned estimation of the initial presence of the target species and accounts for imperfect and incomplete detection of the species presence in the study area. It also uses a metapopulation fitness function derived from Earth observation data subsuming the ecological niche of the target species. This framework is applied to contrast occupancy of two species of carabids ( Pterostichus flavofemoratus , Carabus depressus ) observed in the context of a large ecological monitoring program carried out within the Gran Paradiso National Park (GPNP, Italy). Results suggest that the proposed framework may indeed exploit the hallmarks of spatially explicit ecological approaches and of remote Earth observations. The model reproduces well the observed in situ data. Moreover, it projects in the near term the two species' presence both in space and in time, highlighting the features of the metapopulation dynamics of colonization and extinction, and their expected trends within verifiable timeframes. },

Important large scale applications over the last decade are simulations of the Southern Ocean, the Meridional Overturning Circulation and its variability, and regional sea level change. Submesoscale variability is now routinely resolved in process models and permitted in a few global models, and submesoscale effects are parameterized in most global models. The scales where nonhydrostatic effects become important are beginning to be resolved in regional and process models. Coupling to sea ice, ice shelves, and high-resolution atmospheric models has stimulated new ideas and driven improvements in numerics. Observations have provided insight into turbulence and mixing around the globe and its consequences are assessed through perturbed physics models. Relatedly, parameterizations of the mixing and overturning processes in boundary layers and the ocean interior have improved. New diagnostics being used for evaluating models alongside present and novel observations are briefly referenced. The overall goal is summarizing new developments in ocean modeling, including: how new and existing observations can be used, what modeling challenges remain, and how simulations can be used to support observations.},

Evolutionary convergences among large marine predators are also more than skin deep; those with ancestries on land, such as marine mammals and seabirds, have independently evolved an array of molecular and tissue specializations for maximizing oxygen and warmth (1). Beyond these fantastic traits, marine predators also possess large body sizes and trophic linkages that make them ecologically important consumers in marine food webs.

More inclusive approaches, including community-based conservation (CBC), its subset enterprise-based conservation (EBC), and payments-based conservation (PES) programs, have been tried in the past 15 years. A brief summary of the literature on socio-economic impacts of the exclusionary approach suggests that, although detailed studies and documentation is missing, impacts are significant, and the ethical argument against forced displacement quite strong. We then examine the potential of non-exclusionary approaches from a broader perspective that values biodiversity gains as well as socio-economic ones. Our review suggests that (a) comprehensive socio-ecological and comparative studies of such initiatives are surprisingly scarce, (b) enterprise-based conservation offers some potential if design flaws, poor implementation, assumptions about homogeneous communities, and inattention to tenurial change and security are addressed, (c) payments-based programs require caution because of their focus on economic efficiency, and simplified assumptions regarding the nature of rights, biological information, monitoring costs, and state interventions, and (d) the alternatives to exclusion have often not been given adequate state support and space to function, nor is the ongoing neoliberalization of the political-economic system conducive to giving them that space, except when they fit the direction of this larger process. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Although we have made significant advances in our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of these individual processes, developing an approach that integrates the entire population connectivity process from reproduction, through dispersal, and to the recruitment of individuals has been difficult. We present a population connectivity modelling framework and diagnostic approach for quantifying the impact of i) life histories, ii) demographics, iii) larval dispersal, and iv) the physical seascape, on the structure of connectivity and metapopulation dynamics. We illustrate this approach using the subtidal rocky reef ecosystem of Port Phillip Bay, were we provide a broadly-applicable framework of population connectivity and quantitative methodology for evaluating the relative importance of individual factors in determining local and system outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The spatial characteristics of marine population connectivity are primarily influenced by larval mortality, the duration of the pelagic larval stage, and the settlement competency characteristics, with significant variability imposed by the geographic setting and the timing of larval release. The relative influence and the direction and strength of the main effects were strongly consistent among 10 connectivity-based metrics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These important intrinsic factors (mortality, length of the pelagic larval stage, and the extent of the precompetency window) and the spatial and temporal variability represent key research priorities for advancing our understanding of the connectivity process and metapopulation outcomes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. Purpose: The white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is an important reservoir host for the pathogen responsible for Lyme disease in eastern North-America. Indigenous cases of Lyme disease in southern Quebec have increased from two cases in 2004 to 160 cases in 2015. Because of the strong relationship between the white-footed mouse occurrence and the Lyme disease pathogen prevalence, we can estimate the risk of Lyme disease by finding areas of high contact between mice. In this study, we inferred the movement patterns and contact rate of the white-footed mouse in southern Quebec. Methods: We used pattern-orientated modelling to estimate a directional measure of functional connectivity from an Individual-Based Model. We replicated the spatial pattern observed in previously published molecular analysis of a white-footed mouse population. Results: A perceptual range of 80 m best explained the genetic structure of the white-footed mouse in the region. The paths of individuals generally overlapped the edges of urban centers and the boundary of linear obstacles such as highways and water bodies. We show that the contact probability of mice was a good predictor of the number of mice caught in the field. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the usefulness of individual-based models to potentially predict high contact areas and disease hotspots across landscapes.},

abstract = {The small pelagic fishery in the southern Philippines is one of the largest contributors to fisheries production in the country, and is dominated by the Bali sardine Sardinella lemuru. This species is a year-round spawner that has its peak spawning period during the northeast monsoon (NEM) months of November to February. However, there is still limited information on the conditions that affect this species' survival during its early life history stages. Here, we attempt to discern the importance of temperature, prey density and advection on sardine larvae. The larvae were represented as passive particles that were released in known spawning grounds to simulate dispersal. The conditions the larvae experienced, namely, temperature and estimated prey density based on satellite chlorophyll-a values were recorded at each time step until the estimated recruitment age of 60 days. The temporal and spatial averaged conditions of recruited sardines showed that sardines spawned during the NEM months experienced higher chlorophyll-a, lower (more optimal) sea surface temperature, albeit higher advective loss, than sardines spawned during other months. Comparisons between years showed that during higher reported catch years, sardine larvae experienced lower temperatures and higher retention nearshore. Our results emphasize that sardine stock management efforts need to recognize the contribution of the temporally variable sardine environment to patterns in sardine recruitment and consequently in catches.},

abstract = {Complexity is here approached through an extension of natural philosophy to ecology. Complexity generally has two components - synchronic and diachronic. The first, extensional complexity, explores the structure of form, and process, as nested homeostatic space-time systems of differing scales. In comparison, intensional complexity is essentially developmental, modeling the structure of change as a sere of stages. These occur in a canonical sequence: immaturity ??? maturity ??? senes-senescence, which is proposed as the basis of a developmental systems ecology. Infodynamics is based in the empirical fact that, as systems develop, they store increasing amounts of information. Development is driven by thermodynamic potentials. Energy gradient instability invites energy consumption, leading to growth, which leads to change. The Second Law of thermodynamics can be seen to be the final cause of any development, including succession. It can also be taken, in its Carnot/Clausius formulation, as the final cause of ecological systems, because inefficiency of energy use is an important source of a diversity of energy availabilities. Final cause can be found, not only in variational principles like the Second Law, but is also suggested in widespread similarities (like ecological vicariants) not explained by common descent. It is proposed that deep structures might be considered as a source of these similarities. Structures suggest a semiotic approach, as in, for example, the Umwelt construction of von Uexk??ll, which can be related to the Eltonian niche. In a frictional world, no developing system can resist individuation, which is the source of evolution. Continued individuation in organic evolution results in Hutchinsonian niche deployment. It is driven by mutation, and afforded by a fourth law of thermodynamics which, in non-equilibrium systems generates increases in system workspace. This increases informational entropy as well, resulting ultimately in a diversity of species. While form facilitates physical entropy production, the informational entropy embodied in biological diversity facilitates the fastest possible entropy production at a given locale. The paper ends with a brief on internalism, concerning the generativity of material systems.},

abstract = {The dynamic ebb and flood of tides makes the marine intertidal zone a habitat with temperatures that fluctuate rapidly in both space and time. This is problematic for slow intertidal organisms that cannot move at the speed of tidal fluctuations. The timing of low tides determines which days organisms may experience extreme body temperatures, controlling microclimate to a greater degree than weather patterns. When low tides occur midday, temperatures can exceed critical thermal maxima for many species. Although high shore areas experience the greatest environmental extremes, they often harbor untapped food resources. The periodicity of low tide timing creates a predictable cycle that marine animals can use to obtain food in risky areas while minimizing exposure to thermal extremes. Here, we use a two-part approach to assess whether the snail, Nucella ostrina, uses the predictability of the tidal cycle to obtain food in risky areas while minimizing exposure to thermal extremes. Radio tracking detected the presence/absence of snails in high shore feeding areas continuously for 14 weeks and physical thermal models approximated snail body temperature in those high shore areas. Snails were absent when extreme low tides occurred at times of high solar irradiance (midday). Comparing the subset of physical model body temperatures foraging snails experienced to all available body temperatures in the high shore environment showed snails in foraging areas disproportionately at 9–12 °C and absent at body temperatures {\textgreater} 31 °C, suggesting that N. ostrina is not present when and where thermal risk is greatest. These patterns demonstrate that censusing only at low tide yields an adequate picture of foraging behavior of this species in its natural habitat, and that migratory foraging behavior effectively moderates snail experience of environmental temperature in nature and may buffer this species from aerial warming.},

abstract = {Many studies have reported a correlation between offshore biological changes and large-scale climate forcing. However, it remains unclear if the biological changes in spatially confined estuaries are associated more with large-scale climate forcing or local environmental changes. The Strait of Georgia (SoG) in British Columbia, Canada, was the location used to investigate this question. Based on night zooplankton samples from the surface 20. m, collected between 1990 and 2007, we identified 10 major taxa and investigated interannual changes for September and June. A combination of cluster analysis, Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed an abrupt shift in the September community composition in 1998/1999 associated with a decline in the biomass of euphausiids and calanoid copepods in particular. Although the June samples did not have complete coverage throughout the time period of interest, they confirmed a similar pattern of community change. The PCA analysis showed a phase shift in the large-scale climate indices in 1999. The best single indicator of zooplankton community change was the spring extratropical-based Southern Oscillation Index (SOIx), with a 1-year lag. The best single local indicator was the day of the peak flow of the Fraser River. However, in general, local environmental factors were weakly correlated with zooplankton community changes in the Strait, highlighting this as an important area for future research to understand long-term ecosystem changes. As secondary production plays a key role in food webs, these large changes in the zooplankton community may have had a substantial impact on higher trophic levels and the ecosystem as a whole. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

They are both examples of "functional data", which have become a prevailing type of data. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool and in sparse data situations can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single or multiple index methods we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models, such as time warping, manifold learning, and dynamic modeling with empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

abstract = {The ecological impacts of landscape modification and urbanisation have transformed the composition of plant and animal assemblages, and altered the condition of ecosystems globally. Landscape transformation influences the spatial distribution of species and ecological functions by selecting for generalist species with wide ecological niches, which can adapt to opportunities in highly-modified environments. These effects of landscape modification can shape functional diversity on land, but it is not clear whether they have similar functional consequences in the sea. We used estuaries as a model system to test how landscape transformation alters functional diversity in coastal seascapes, and measured how variation in level of urbanisation, catchment modification and habitat loss influenced fish diversity across thirty-nine estuaries in eastern Australia. Fish were surveyed with baited remote underwater video stations and functional diversity was indexed with three metrics that describe variation in the functional traits and niche space of assemblages. The extent of landscape transformation in the catchment of each estuary was associated with variation in the functional diversity of estuarine fish assemblages. These effects were, however, not what we expected as functional diversity was highest in modified estuaries that supported a large area of both urban and grazing land in their catchments, were bordered by a small area of natural terrestrial vegetation and that contained a moderate area of mangroves. Zoobenthivores and omnivores dominated assemblages in highly-modified estuaries, and piscivorous fishes were common in natural waterways. Our results demonstrate, that the modification and urbanisation of ecosystems on land can alter functional diversity in the sea. Intense landscape transformation appears to select for abundant generalists with wide trophic niches, and against species with specialised diets, and we suggest that these changes might have fundamental consequences for ecosystem functioning in estuaries, and other highly modified seascapes.},

abstract = {The study and implementation of no-take marine reserves have increased rapidly over the past decade, providing ample data on the biological effects of reserve protection for a wide range of geographic locations and organisms. The plethora of new studies affords the opportunity to re- evaluate previous findings and address formerly unanswered questions with extensive data synthe- ses. Our results show, on average, positive effects of reserve protection on the biomass, numerical density, species richness, and size of organisms within their boundaries which are remarkably simi- lar to those of past syntheses despite a near doubling of data. New analyses indicate that (1) these results do not appear to be an artifact of reserves being sited in better locations; (2) results do not appear to be driven by displaced fishing effort outside of reserves; (3) contrary to often-made asser- tions, reserves have similar if not greater positive effects in temperate settings, at least for reef ecosystems; (4) even small reserves can produce significant biological responses irrespective of lati- tude, although more data are needed to test whether reserve effects scale with reserve size; and (5) effects of reserves vary for different taxonomic groups and for taxa with various characteristics, and not all species increase in response to reserve protection. There is considerable variation in the responses documented across all the reserves in our data set—variability which cannot be entirely explained by which species were studied. We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, par- ticularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response. However, despite considerable variability, positive responses are far more common than no differences or negative responses, validating the potential for well designed and enforced reserves to serve as globally important conservation and management tools},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd Aim: Metacommunity assembly mechanisms have been traditionally considered stable through time. However, in highly dynamic systems with varying local environmental conditions and patch connectivity, communities are likely to experience temporal shifts in their assembly mechanisms. Here, we used a set of perennial (PR) and intermittent (IR) rivers to assess if assembly mechanisms vary seasonally in response to flow intermittence. Location: Mediterranean climate region (100,000 km 2 ), Spain. Methods: We used a modelling approach to assess the relative effect of environmental sorting and dispersal-based processes on aquatic invertebrate metacommunities within and across river types at four distinct hydrological periods. We used local environmental variables to assess environmental sorting, and considered geographical, network and topographical distances as different dispersal surrogates. Linear mixed effect models accounting for the non-independence of pairwise distances were used to assess the relationships between community dissimilarity and distance matrices. Results: Assembly mechanisms were more temporally stable in PR than in IR. In PR, community dissimilarities were equally related to environmental and geographical distances suggesting codominance of species sorting and dispersal-based assembly mechanisms. In IR, environmental distance best explained community dissimilarities during the dry period when flow cessation imposes strong environmental sorting, whereas metacommunity organization was much more stochastic during the rewetting period when high flows may randomly reorganize communities. Dispersal processes dominated assembly mechanisms between PR and IR during the rewetting period suggesting an increase in recolonization processes linking both river types following the dry period. Geographical and topographical distances best explained community variability, suggesting that overland dispersal dominates in river networks fragmented by drying events. Main conclusions: Aquatic invertebrate metacommunity assembly mechanisms vary seasonally in response to changes in hydrological conditions. The temporal dimension should be better incorporated into metacommunity studies in highly dynamic systems such as intermittent rivers.},

abstract = {Increases in the frequency, severity and duration of temperature extremes are anticipated in the near future. Although recent work suggests that changes in temperature variation will have disproportionately greater effects on species than changes to the mean, much of climate change research in ecology has focused on the impacts of mean temperature change. Here, we couple fine- grained climate projections (2050–2059) to thermal performance data from 38 ectothermic invertebrate species and contrast projections with those of a simple model. We show that projections based on mean temperature change alone differ substantially from those incorporating changes to the variation, and to the mean and variation in concert. Although most species show increases in performance at greater mean temperatures, the effect of mean and variance change together yields a range of responses, with temperate species at greatest risk of performance declines. Our work highlights the importance of using fine-grained temporal data to incorporate the full extent of temperature variation when assessing and projecting performance. 1.},

abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is a valuable tool to map and monitor the distribution of marine macrophytes such as seagrass and seaweeds that perform many ecological functions and services in coastal habitats. Various satellites have been used to map the distribution of these coastal bottom habitat-forming species, with each sensor providing unique benefits. In this study, we first explored optimal methods to create bottom habitat maps using WorldView-3 satellite imagery. We secondly compared the WorldView-3 bottom habitat maps to previously produced Sentinel-2 maps in a temperate, optically complex environment in Nova Scotia, Canada to identify the top performing classification and the advantages and disadvantages of each sensor. Sentinel-2 provides a global, freely accessible dataset where four bands are available at a 10-m spatial resolution in the visible and near infrared spectrum. Conversely, WorldView-3 is a commercial satellite where eight bands are available at a 2-m spatial resolution in the visible and near infrared spectrum, but data catalogs are costly and limited in scope. Our optimal WorldView-3 workflow processed images from digital numbers to habitat classification maps, and included a semiautomatic stripe correction. Our comparison of bottom habitat maps explored the impact of improved WorldView-3 spatial resolution in isolation, and the combined advantage of both WorldView's increased spatial and spectral resolution relative to Sentinel-2. We further explored the effect of tidal height on classification success, and relative changes in water clarity between images collected at different dates. As expected, both sensors are suitable for bottom habitat mapping. The value of WorldView-3 came from both its increased spatial and spectral resolution, particularly for fragmented vegetation, and the value of Sentinel-2 imagery comes from its global dataset that readily allows for large scale habitat mapping. Given the variation in scale, cost and resolution of the two sensors, we provide recommendations on their use for mapping and monitoring marine macrophyte habitat in Atlantic Canada, with potential applications to other coastal areas of the world.},

abstract = {Theory and small-scale experiments predict that biodiversity losses can decrease the magnitude and stability of ecosystem services such as production and nutrient cycling. Most of this research, however, has been isolated from the immigration and emigration (dispersal) processes that create and maintain diversity in nature. As common anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity change--such as habitat fragmentation, species introductions and climate change--are mediated by these understudied processes, it is unclear how environmental degradation will affect ecosystem services. Here we tested the interactive effects of mobile grazer diversity and dispersal on the magnitude and stability of ecosystem properties in experimental seagrass communities that were either isolated or connected by dispersal corridors. We show that, contrary to theoretical predictions, increasing the number of mobile grazer species in these metacommunities increased the spatial and temporal variability of primary and secondary production. Moreover, allowing grazers to move among and select patches reduced diversity effects on production. Finally, effects of diversity on stability differed qualitatively between patch and metacommunity scales. Our results indicate that declining biodiversity and habitat fragmentation synergistically influence the predictability of ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {The concepts of metapopulation persistence and source- sink dynamics are central and often untested tenets of marine reserve networks. Effective application of these concepts to marine reserves is limited by data on demographic rates within reserves and larval connectivity among reserves. Using a network of reserves established to restore eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA as our model system, we integrated empirically based demographic rates and regional hydrodynamic- based connectivity estimates within a metapopulation model to (1) evaluate the potential for the reserve network to function as a self- persistent oyster metapopulation, (2) determine the relative importance of demographics vs. connectivity on reserve source- sink dynamics, (3) assess the efficacy of stock enhancement in promoting metapopulation persistence, and (4) evaluate whether application of a Few Large or Several Small reserves—a modification of the Single Large or Several Small concept— promoted greater metapopulation retention of larvae within the reserve network (i.e., local larval reten- tion within reserves + larval connectivity among reserves). The reserve network failed to function as a self- persistent metapopulation, despite exceptional demographic rates within reserves. When considering only larval supply from reserves, local retention and connectivity were insufficient to provide annual replacement (≥{\~{}}0.25 recruits per adult). Accordingly, reserves contributed to the metapopulation primarily via production, not dispersal, of larvae and reserve source- sink dynamics were influenced more by demo- graphics within reserves, particularly adult growth and survival, than larval connectivity among reserves. Addressing recruitment limitation via stock enhancement was not effective at augmenting projected meta- population declines. Several small reserves initially promoted greater metapopulation retention of larvae than a few large reserves, however, as the number or area of reserves increased, metapopulation retention was equivalent among designs, suggesting that Few Large and Several Small reserves may be the best network design. Marine reserves can be an effective restoration tool for improving demographic rates within reserve boundaries, but designation of multiple reserves does not guarantee a functional reserve network metapopulation. Both demographics and larval connectivity are important considerations to successful application of metapopulation concepts to the design of reserve networks.},

While modularity remains one of the more popular methods of community detection, the so-called resolution limit remains a significant drawback. To overcome this issue, it was recently suggested that instead of comparing the network to a random null model, as is done in modularity, it should be compared to a constant factor. However, it is unclear what is meant exactly by "resolution-limit-free," that is, not suffering from the resolution limit. Furthermore, the question remains what other methods could be classified as resolution-limit-free. In this paper we suggest a rigorous definition and derive some basic properties of resolution-limit-free methods. More importantly, we are able to prove exactly which class of community detection methods are resolution-limit-free. Furthermore, we analyze which methods are not resolution-limit-free, suggesting there is only a limited scope for resolution-limit-free community detection methods. Finally, we provide such a natural formulation, and show it performs superbly. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

Traditionally, restoration efforts have focused on re-establishing historical disturbance regimes or abiotic conditions, relying on successional processes to guide the recovery of biotic communities. However, strong feedbacks between biotic factors and the physical environment can alter the efficacy of these successional-based management efforts. Recent experimental work indicates that some degraded systems are resilient to traditional restoration efforts owing to constraints such as changes in landscape connectivity and organization, loss of native species pools, shifts in species dominance, trophic interactions and/or invasion by exotics, and concomitant effects on biogeochemical processes. Models of alternative ecosystem states that incorporate system thresholds and feedbacks are now being applied to the dynamics of recovery in degraded systems and are suggesting ways in which restoration can identify, prioritize and address these constraints.},

Using data on 288 Mediterranean fish species with varying conservation requirements, we show that: (2) considering both representation and connectivity objectives provides the best strategy for enhanced bio-diversity persistence and (2) connectivity objectives were fundamental to enhancing persistence of small-ranged species, which are most in need of conservation, while the representation objective benefited only wide-ranging species. Our approach provides a more comprehensive appraisal of planning applications than approaches focusing on either representation or connectivity, and will hopefully contribute to build more effective reserve networks for the persistence of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Connectivity, the exchange of individuals among locations, is a fundamental ecological process that explains how otherwise disparate populations interact. For most marine organisms, dispersal occurs primarily during a pelagic larval phase that connects populations. We paired population structure from comprehensive genetic sampling and biophysical larval transport modeling to describe how spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) population differentiation is related to biological oceanography. A total of 581 lobsters were genotyped with 11 microsatellites from ten locations around the greater Caribbean. The overall F ST of 0.0016 (P = 0.005) suggested low yet significant levels of structuring among sites. An isolation by geographic distance model did not explain spatial patterns of genetic differentiation in P. argus (P = 0.19; Mantel r = 0.18), whereas a biophysical connectivity model provided a significant explanation of population differentiation (P = 0.04; Mantel r = 0.47). Thus, even for a widely dispersing species, dispersal occurs over a continuum where basin-wide larval retention creates genetic structure. Our study provides a framework for future explorations of wide-scale larval dispersal and marine connectivity by integrating empirical genetic research and probabilistic modeling.},

abstract = {The extent of larval dispersal on coral reefs has important implications for the persistence of coral reef metapopulations, their resilience and recovery from an increasing array of threats, and the success of protective measures. This article highlights a recent dramatic increase in research effort and a growing diversity of approaches to the study of larval retention within (self-recruitment) and dispersal among (connectivity) isolated coral reef populations. Historically, researchers were motivated by alternative hypotheses concerning the processes limiting populations and structuring coral reef assemblages, whereas the recent impetus has come largely from the need to incorporate dispersal information into the design of no-take marine protected area (MPA) networks. Although the majority of studies continue to rely on population genetic approaches to make inferences about dispersal, a wide range of techniques are now being employed, from small-scale larval tagging and paternity analyses, to large-scale biophysical circulation models. Multiple approaches are increasingly being applied to cross-validate and provide more realistic estimates of larval dispersal. The vast majority of empirical studies have focused on corals and fishes, where evidence for both extremely local scale patterns of self-recruitment and ecologically significant connectivity among reefs at scales of tens of kilometers (and in some cases hundreds of kilometers) is accumulating. Levels of larval retention and the spatial extent of connectivity in both corals and fishes appear to be largely independent of larval duration or reef size, but may be strongly influenced by geographic setting. It is argued that high levels of both self-recruitment and larval import can contribute to the resilience of reef populations and MPA networks, but these benefits will erode in degrading reef environments. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

Th ese ecological functions ultimately support the ecosystem services upon which humanity depends. Despite hundreds of experimental tests of the eff ect of biodiversity on ecosystem function (BEF), it remains unclear whether diversity eff ects are suffi ciently general that we can use a single relationship to quantitatively predict how changes in species richness alter an ecosystem function across trophic levels, ecosystems and ecological conditions. Our objective here is to determine whether a general relationship exists between biodiversity and standing biomass. We used hierarchical mixed eff ects models, based on a power function between species richness and biomass production (Y ϭ a ϫ S b), and a database of 374 published experiments to estimate the BEF relationship (the change in biomass with the addition of species), and its associated uncertainty, in the context of environmental factors. We found that the mean relationship (b ϭ 0.26, 95{\%} CI: 0.16, 0.37) characterized the vast majority of observations, was robust to diff erences in experimental design, and was independent of the range of species richness levels considered. However, the richness – biomass relationship varied by trophic level and among ecosystems; in aquatic systems b was nearly twice as large for consumers (herbivores and detritivores) compared to primary producers; in terrestrial ecosystems, b for detritivores was negative but depended on few studies. We estimated changes in biomass expected for a range of changes in species richness, highlighting that species loss has greater implications than species gains, skewing a distribution of biomass change relative to observed species richness change. When biomass provides a good proxy for processes that underpin ecosystem services, this relationship could be used as a step in modeling the production of ecosystem services and their dependence on biodiversity.},

abstract = {As resource management and conservation efforts move toward multi-sector, ecosystem-based approaches, we need methods for comparing the varying responses of ecosystems to the impacts of human activities in order to prioritize management efforts, allocate limited resources, and understand cumulative effects. Given the number and variety of human activities affecting ecosystems, relatively few empirical studies are adequately comprehensive to inform these decisions. Consequently, management often turns to expert judgment for information. Drawing on methods from decision science, we offer a method for eliciting expert judgment to (1) quantitatively estimate the relative vulnerability of ecosystems to stressors, (2) help prioritize the management of stressors across multiple ecosystems, (3) evaluate how experts give weight to different criteria to characterize vulnerability of ecosystems to anthropogenic stressors, and (4) identify key knowledge gaps. We applied this method to the California Current region in order to evaluate the relative vulnerability of 19 marine ecosystems to 53 stressors associated with human activities, based on surveys from 107 experts. When judging the relative vulnerability of ecosystems to stressors, we found that experts primarily considered two criteria: the ecosystem's resistance to the stressor and the number of species or trophic levels affected. Four intertidal ecosystems (mudflat, beach, salt marsh, and rocky intertidal) were judged most vulnerable to the suite of human activities evaluated here. The highest vulnerability rankings for coastal ecosystems were invasive species, ocean acidification, sea temperature change, sea level rise, and habitat alteration from coastal engineering, while offshore ecosystems were assessed to be most vulnerable to ocean acidification, demersal destructive fishing, and shipwrecks. These results provide a quantitative, transparent, and repeatable assessment of relative vulnerability across ecosystems to any ongoing or emerging human activity. Combining these results with data on the spatial distribution and intensity of human activities provides a systematic foundation for ecosystem-based management.},

Yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus, YR) are widely distributed across the northeastern Pacific Ocean, inhabiting coastal rocky reefs from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska through southern California. This species exhibits an extended pelagic larval duration and has the capacity for long distance larval transport. We assayed 2,862 YR individuals from 13 general areas in the northeast Pacific Ocean for allelic variation at nine microsatellite loci. Bayesian model-based clustering analyses grouped individuals from the Strait of Georgia (SG) into a distinct genetic cluster, while individuals from outer coastal water locations (OCLs) were partitioned equally across two genetic clusters, including the cluster associated with the SG fish. Pairwise FST values were consistently an order of magnitude higher for comparisons between the SG and OCLs than they were for all OCL-OCL comparisons (∼0.016 vs. ∼0.001). This same pattern was observed across two time points when individuals were binned into an "old" and "young" group according to birth year (old: ∼0.020 vs. 0.0003; young: ∼0.020 vs. ∼0.004). Additionally, mean allelic richness was markedly lower within the SG compared to the OCLs (8.00 vs. 10.54-11.77). These results indicate that the Strait of Georgia "deep-basin" estuary oceanographic domain acts as a dispersal barrier from the outer coastal waters via the Juan de Fuca Strait. Alternatively, selection against maladapted dispersers across this oceanographic transition may underlie the observed genetic differentiation between the Georgia basin and the outer coastal waters, and further work is needed to confirm the SG-OCL divide acts as a barrier to larval dispersal.},

abstract = {We investigated the effects of differing spatial scales of seagrass habitat architecture on the composition and abundance of settling bivalves in a sub-tropical seagrass community. The density of newly settled bivalves was generally greater at Thalassia testudinum grass bed edge ({\textless} 1 m) compared to interior portions of the bed ({\textgreater} 10 m). Deviation from this generalized pattern occurred when high densities of newly settled tulip mussels (Modiolus americanus) were recorded from the interior of the meadow, associated with aggregations of adult mussels. Bivalve settling densities appear to reflect settlement shadows of passively delivered larvae, bedload transport of newly settled individuals from unvegetated regions, as well as gregarious settlement among adult conspecifics. We also investigated the impact of seagrass patch shape and size on settlement by using artificial seagrass units (ASU) in separate short-term and long-term experiments. We found a positive relationship between ASU perimeter and bivalve abundance, suggesting that larval encounter rates with seagrass habitat may determine initial settlement patterns. Using ASUs we also investigated the relative role seagrass epiphytes play in determining the density of settling bivalves. Results showed greater settling densities where epiphytic secondary structure was elevated compared to controls, and bivalve density was significantly greater when ASUs were fouled with a natural community of epiphytes, suggesting that both microstructure and biofilms positively influenced bivalve settlement. We conclude that structural components of seagrass habitats increase bivalve settlement at multiple spatial scales, including epiphytic micro-structure, small-scale patch shape and size, and large-scale within habitat differences.},

In this study, we analyse Posidonia oceanica litter decomposition and invertebrate colonization in three sites with different hydrodynamics in a coastal basin. Litterbags were put on the sea bed along a gradient of distance from the open sea, implying a different level of water exchange. Leaf litter mass loss and carbon and nitrogen concentration were analysed, and density and biomass of benthic invertebrates colonizing litterbags were recorded after 3, 7, 14, 47, 101, 152 and 221 days. Results showed that in the most sheltered site, the leaf litter decomposition rate, the invertebrate density and biomass and the detrital carbon release were the lowest. The reduction of the decomposition rates of seagrass leaves in the site characterized by low hydrodynamic forces may promote organic matter burial and carbon stocks, emphasizing the role of coastal basins such as ponds and lagoons as sinks of carbon and the important role of seagrass detritus in the Blue Carbon global balance.},

Ensuring representation of species in MPAs, however, would require protecting vast areas of the global oceans and does not explicitly prioritize species of conservation concern. When threatened species are considered, a recent study found that only a small fraction of their geographic ranges are within the global MPA network. Which global marine areas, and what conservation actions beyond MPAs could be prioritized to prevent marine extinctions (Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 12), remains unknown. Here, we use systematic conservation planning approaches to prioritize conservation actions for sharks, rays and chimaeras (class Chondrichthyes). We use chondrichthyans as they have the highest proportion of threatened species of any marine class. We find that expanding the MPA network by 3{\%} in 70 nations would cover half of the geographic range of 99 imperilled endemic chondrichthyans. Our hotspot analysis reveals that just 12 nations harbour more than half (53) of the imperilled endemics. Four of these hotspot nations are within the top ten chondrichthyan fishing nations in the world, but are yet to implement basic chondrichthyan fisheries management. Given their geopolitical realities, conservation action for some countries will require relief and reorganization to enable sustainable fisheries and species protection.},

We detail the principles and practical aspects of this framework and apply it to simulated datasets to illustrate its ability to decipher the respective contributions of entangled drivers of metacommunity dynamics. We then apply it to four empirical datasets. Empirical results support the view that metacommunity dynamics may be generally shaped by multiple ecological processes acting in concert, with environmental filtering being variable across both space and time. These results reinforce our call to go beyond static analyses of metacommunities that are blind to the temporal part of environmental variability.},

In the category of passive dispersers, large-bodied groups showed stronger spatial patterning than small-bodied groups suggesting an increasing impact of dispersal limitation with increasing body size. Metacommunities of organisms with the ability to fly (i.e. insect groups) showed a weaker imprint of dispersal limitation than passive dispersers with similar body size. In contrast, dispersal movements of vertebrate groups (fish and amphibians) seemed to be mainly confined to local connectivity patterns. Our results reveal that body size and dispersal mode are important drivers of metacommunity structure and these traits should therefore be considered when developing a predictive framework for metacommunity dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {In response to concerns about human impacts to coastal ecosystems, conservationists and practitioners are increasingly turning to networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). Although MPAs manage for fishing pressure, many species and habitats in MPAs remain exposed to a multitude of stressors, including stressors from global climate change and regional land- and ocean-based activities. To support the adaptive management of MPAs that are subject to multiple interacting stressors, coastal managers need to understand the potential impacts from other single and multiple stressors. To demonstrate how this can be done, we quantify and map cumulative impacts resulting from multiple stressors to California's network of MPAs, using a widely available cumulative impacts mapping tool. Among individual stressors, those related to climate, including ocean acidification, UV radiation increases, and SST anomalies, were found to have the most intense impacts, especially on surface waters and in the rocky intertidal. Climate stressors are challenging to limit at the local MPA scale, but intense land- and ocean-based impacts that were found to affect a majority of MPAs, such as sediment increases, invasive species, organic pollutants and pollution from shipping and ports, may be more easily regulated at a regional or local scale. This is especially relevant for South and Central coast MPAs where these impacts are the greatest on beaches, tidal flats, and coastal marshes. Accounting for cumulative impacts from these and other stressors when developing monitoring and management plans in California and across the world, would help to improve the efficacy of MPAs.},

abstract = {Systematic conservation planning (SCP) is a field of conservation biology concerned with delivering on-the-ground actions that achieve conservation goals. It describes a set of operational models that cover both design and implementation of conservation, with a strong focus on mobilising the collective action typically required to implement conservation. SCP, as it was originally described, was composed of six different stages: collection of data, identification of conservation goals, evaluation of the existing protected area network, design of expansions, implementation of conservation action, and long-term maintenance of biodiversity in the network. Since then, the operational model has been expanded into several different variants. Conservation actions applied inside SCP include establishment and expansion of reserve networks and allocation of habitat restoration and management. Within the broader context of SCP, there is a fundamental biogeographic-economic analysis frequently called spatial conservation prioritisation or conservation assessment, which is used for identifying where important areas for biodiversity are and how conservation goals might be achieved efficiently. Here, we review the usage and meaning of the 12 biogeographic-economic core concepts of SCP: adequacy, complementarity, comprehensiveness, effectiveness, efficiency, flexibility, irreplaceability, replacement cost, representation, representativeness, threat, and vulnerability. Some of the concepts have clear definitions whereas others may have alternative and possibly conflicting definitions. With a comprehensive literature review literature, we elucidate the historical backgrounds of these concepts, the first definitions and usages, alternative later definitions, key applications, and prior reviews. This review reduces linguistic uncertainty in the application of SCP. Since SCP is a global activity with a multitude of different stakeholders involved, it is vital that those involved can speak the same language. Through these concepts, this review serves as a source of information about the historical development of SCP. It provides a comprehensive review for anyone wishing to understand the key concepts of spatial prioritisation within SCP.},

Global warming will make parts of Antarctica more habitable for invasive taxa, yet presumed barriers to dispersal—especially the Southern Ocean's strong, circumpolar winds, ocean currents and fronts—have been thought to protect the region from non-anthropogenic colonizations from the north1,2. We combine molecular and oceanographic tools to directly test for biological dispersal across the Southern Ocean. Genomic analyses reveal that rafting keystone kelps recently travelled {\textgreater}20,000 km and crossed several ocean-front ‘barriers' to reach Antarctica from mid-latitude source populations. High-resolution ocean circulation models, incorporating both mesoscale eddies and wave-driven Stokes drift, indicate that such Antarctic incursions are remarkably frequent and rapid. Our results demonstrate that storm-forced surface waves and ocean eddies can dramatically enhance oceanographic connectivity for drift particles in surface layers, and show that Antarctica is not biologically isolated. We infer that Antarctica's long-standing ecological differences have been the result of environmental extremes that have precluded the establishment of temperate-adapted taxa, but that such taxa nonetheless frequently disperse to the region. Global warming thus has the potential to allow the establishment of diverse new species—including keystone kelps that would drastically alter ecosystem dynamics—even without anthropogenic introductions.},

abstract = {Instantaneous implementation of systematic conservation plans at regional scales is rare. More typically, planned actions are applied incrementally over periods of years or decades. During protracted implementation, the character of the connected ecological system will change as a function of external anthropogenic pressures, local metapopulation processes, and environmental fluctuations. For heavily exploited systems, habitat quality will deteriorate as the plan is implemented, potentially influencing the schedule of protected area implementation necessary to achieve conservation objectives. Understanding the best strategy to adopt for applying management within a connected environment is desirable, especially given limited conservation resources. Here, we model the sequential application of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) in the central Philippines within a metapopulation framework, using a range of network-based decision rules. The model was based on selecting 33 sites for protection from 101 possible sites over a 35-yr period. The graph-theoretic network criteria to select sites for protection included PageRank, maximum degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, minimum degree, random, and historical events. We also included a dynamic strategy called colonization–extinction rate that was updated every year based on the changing capacity of each site to produce and absorb larvae. Each rule was evaluated in the context of achieving the maximum metapopulation mean lifetime at the conclusion of the implementation phase. MPAs were designated through the alteration of the extinction risk parameter. The highest ranked criteria were PageRank while the actual implementation from historical records ranked lowest. Our results indicate that protecting the sites ranked highest with regard to larval supply is likely to yield the highest benefit for fish abundance and fish metapopulation persistence. Model results highlighted the benefits of including network processes in conservation planning.},

Seawater properties inside and outside the Fraser plume were measured with high spatial and temporal resolution for an extended period. Here the salinity and chlorophyll-a fluorescence records are used to determine how the Fraser River plume affects phytoplankton biomass in the Strait of Georgia over a range of time scales. The fluorescence record is corrected for non-photochemical quenching by comparison of daytime and nighttime samples, and then calibrated in a manner traceable to extracted chlorophyll measurements. Analysis shows that the instantaneous along-track structure of near-surface chlorophyll-a is often sensitive to the presence of the Fraser River plume. However, when averaged over the 4-year time series, the plume has little impact. Depth-integrated chlorophyll-a biomass is then estimated by applying scaling factors derived from vertical profiles. Unlike the near-surface measurements, depth-integrated biomass in the plume is on average only 74{\%} of the amount found in neighboring waters. Potential reasons for this discrepancy are discussed in terms of light attenuation, the vertical distribution of chlorophyll-a, plume fresh water fraction, and flushing time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The distance travelled by marine larvae varies by seven orders of magnitude. Dispersal shapes marine biodiversity, and must be understood if marine systems are to be well managed. Because warmer temperatures quicken larval development, larval durations might be systematically shorter in the tropics relative to those at high latitudes. Nevertheless, life history and hydrodynamics also covary with latitude—these also affect dispersal, precluding any clear expectation of how dispersal changes at a global scale. Here we combine data from the literature encompassing {\textgreater}750 marine organisms from seven phyla with oceanographic data on current speeds, to quantify the overall latitudinal gradient in larval dispersal distance. We find that planktonic duration increased with latitude, confirming predictions that temperature effects outweigh all others across global scales. However, while tropical species have the shortest planktonic durations, realized dispersal distances were predicted to be greatest in the tropics and at high latitudes, and lowest at mid-latitudes. At high latitudes, greater dispersal distances were driven by moderate current speed and longer planktonic durations. In the tropics, fast currents overwhelmed the effect of short planktonic durations. Our results contradict previous hypotheses based on biology or physics alone; rather, biology and physics together shape marine dispersal patterns.},

Questions about larval transport focus largely on (a) where they go [dispersal] and (b) where they come from [connectivity]. Mechanisms of transport have been intensively studied in recent decades. As our ability to identify larval sources develops, the consequences of connectivity are garnering more consideration. Attention to transport and connectivity issues has increased dramatically in the past decade, fueled by changing motivations that now include management of fisheries resources, understanding of the spread of invasive species, conservation through the design of marine reserves, and prediction of climate-change effects. Current progress involves both technological advances and the integration of disciplines and approaches. This review focuses on insights gained from physical modeling, chemical tracking, and genetic approaches. I consider how new findings are motivating paradigm shifts concerning (1) life-history consequences; (2) the openness of marine populations, self-recruitment, and population connectivity; (3) the role of behavior; and (4) the significance of variability in space and time. A challenge for the future will be to integrate methods that address dispersal on short (intragenerational) timescales such as elemental fingerprinting and numerical simulations with those that reflect longer timescales such as gene flow estimates and demographic modeling. Recognition and treatment of the continuum between ecological and evolutionary timescales will be necessary to advance the mechanistic understanding of larval and population dynamics. {\textcopyright} The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology 2006.

abstract = {Biophysical dispersal models for marine fish larvae are widely used by marine ecologists and managers of fisheries and marine protected areas to predict movement of larval fishes during their pelagic larval duration (PLD). Over the past 25 years, it has become obvious that behaviour—primarily vertical positioning, horizontal swimming and orientation—of larvae during their PLD can strongly influence dispersal outcomes. Yet, most published models do not include even one of these behaviours, and only a tiny fraction include all three. Furthermore, there is no clarity on how behaviours should be incorporated into models, nor on how to obtain the quantitative, empirical data needed to parameterize models. The PLD is a period of morphological, physiological and behavioural change, which presents challenges for modelling. The present paper aims to encourage the inclusion of larval behaviour in biophysical dispersal models for larvae of marine demersal fishes by providing practical suggestions, advice and insights about obtaining and incorporating behaviour of larval fishes into such models based on experience. Key issues are features of different behavioural metrics, incorporation of ontogenetic, temporal, spatial and among-individual variation, and model validation. Research on behaviour of larvae of study species should be part of any modelling effort.},

Species diversity is changing globally and locally, but the complexity of ecological communities hampers a general understanding of the consequences of animal species loss on ecosystem functioning.

Depending on the balance of these counteracting mechanisms, species-rich animal communities may put plants under top-down control or may release them from grazing pressure. Using a dynamic food-web model with body-mass constraints, we simulate ecosystem functions of 20,000 communities of varying animal diversity. We show that diverse animal communities accumulate more biomass and are more exploitative on plants, despite their higher rates of intra-guild predation. However, they do not reduce plant biomass because the communities are composed of larger, and thus energetically more efficient, plant and animal species. This plasticity of community body-size structure reconciles the debate on the consequences of animal species loss for primary productivity.},

abstract = {Blue carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows has been proposed as a low-risk, nature-based solution to offset carbon emissions and reduce the effects of climate change. Although the timescale of seagrass carbon burial is too short to offset emissions of ancient fossil fuel carbon, it has a role to play in reaching net zero within the modern carbon cycle. This review documents and discusses recent advances (from 2015 onwards) in the field of seagrass blue carbon. The net burial of carbon is affected by seagrass species, meadow connectivity, sediment bioturbation, grainsize, the energy of the local environment, and calcium carbonate formation. The burial rate of organic carbon can be calculated as the product of the sediment accumulation rate below the mixed layer and the burial concentration of organic carbon attributable to seagrass. A combination of biomarkers can identify seagrass material more precisely than bulk isotopes alone. The main threats related to climate change are sea-level rise, leading to a shoreline squeeze, and temperature rise, particularly during extreme events such as heat domes. In conclusion, some of the disagreement in the literature over methodology and the main controls on organic carbon burial likely results from real, regional differences in seagrasses and their habitat. Inter-regional collaboration could help to resolve the methodological differences and provide a more robust understanding of the global role of blue carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows.},

Successful application of MPAs will be predicated on the ability to monitor biodiversity in a synoptic and noninvasive manner. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods have important advantages over traditional biodiversity survey methods for monitoring conservation areas. To evaluate the efficacy of eDNA metabarcoding for fish biodiversity monitoring, we sampled 19 coastal eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in Canada, as eelgrass beds are known for high biodiversity and significant conservation value. At each site, beach seines were used to survey fish and water samples were collected contemporaneously for eDNA metabarcoding. In total, beach seining caught 32 672 individuals across 59 fish taxa, and eDNA detected 129 fish taxa. eDNA captured site-level variation and detected higher species richness at both site and regional levels compared to seining. eDNA abundance had a positive association with capture abundance. Collectively these results highlight how eDNA metabarcoding offers an efficient approach for monitoring fish biodiversity in coastal eelgrass beds, thus providing a valuable and noninvasive tool for MPA planning and coastal monitoring.},

However, connecting cumulative impact scores to actual ecosystem change at appropriate spatial scales remains challenging. Here, we calculated cumulative effects (CE) scores for 187 seagrass beds in Atlantic Canada that accounts for both bay-scale and local-scale anthropogenic activities. We then developed a CE threshold to evaluate where degradation of seagrass beds from multiple human activities is more likely. Overall, the CE score was the best predictor of human impacts for seagrass beds. Locations with high watershed land alteration and nitrogen loading had the highest CE scores; however, we also identified seagrass beds with high CE scores in regions characterized by generally low levels of human activities. Forty-nine seagrass beds exceeded the CE threshold and, of these, 86{\%} had CE scores that were influenced by three or more stressors that cumulatively amounted to a large score. This CE threshold approach can provide a simplified metric to identify areas where management of cumulative effects should be prioritized and further highlights the need to consider multiple human activities when assessing anthropogenic impacts to coastal habitats.},

abstract = {Understanding the physical mechanisms behind the transport and accumulation of floating objects in the ocean is crucial to efficiently tackle the issue of marine pollution. The main sinks of marine plastic are the coast and the bottom sediment. This study focuses on the former, investigating the timescales of dispersal from the ocean surface and onto coastal accumulation areas through a process called “beaching.” Previous studies found that the Stokes drift can reach the same magnitude as the Eulerian current speed and that it has a long-term effect on the trajectories of floating objects. Two particle tracking models (PTMs) are carried out and then compared, one with and one without Stokes drift, named PTM-SD and PTM-REF, respectively. Eulerian velocity and Stokes drift data from global reanalysis datasets are used for particle advection. Particles in the PTM-SD model are found to beach at a yearly rate that is double the rate observed in PTM-REF. The main coastal attractors are consistent with the direction of large-scale atmospheric circulation (Westerlies and Trade Winds). After 12 years (at the end of the run), the amount of beached particles is 20{\%} larger in PTM-SD than in PTM-REF. Long-term predictions carried out with the aid of adjacency matrices found that after 100 years all particles have beached in PTM-SD, while 8{\%} of the all seeded particles are still floating in PTM-REF. The results confirm the need to accurately represent the Stokes drift in particle models attempting to predict the behaviour of marine debris, in order to avoid overestimation of its residence time in the ocean and effectively guide policies toward prevention and removal.},

abstract = {Dispersal is generally difficult to directly observe. Instead, dispersal is often inferred from genetic markers and biophysical modelling where a correspondence indicates that dispersal routes and barriers explain a significant part of population genetic differentiation. Biophysical models are used for wind-driven dispersal in terrestrial environments and for propagules drifting with ocean currents in the sea. In the ocean, such seascape genetic or seascape genomic studies provide promising tools in applied sciences, as actions within management and conservation rely on an understanding of population structure, genetic diversity and presence of local adaptations, all dependent on dispersal within the metapopulation. Here, we surveyed 87 studies that combine population genetics and biophysical models of dispersal. Our aim was to understand if biophysical dispersal models can generally explain genetic differentiation. Our analysis shows that genetic differentiation and lack of genetic differentiation can often be explained by dispersal, but the realism of the biophysical model, as well as local geomorphology and species biology also play a role. The review supports the use of a combination of both methods, and we discuss our findings in terms of recommendations for future studies and pinpoint areas where further development is necessary, particularly on how to compare both approaches.

Knowledge of connectivity patterns in marine populations is fundamental for defining population viability and progressing with management and conservation goals. Here, we developed a biophysical, individual-based larval dispersal model to assess the effect of oceanographic variability and biological traits (i.e. larval diel vertical migration [DVM] and temperature-dependent larval development [PLD]) on recruitment success, dispersal distance, and alongshore connectivity patterns. We selected 2 species exploited by Chilean artisanal fisheries: Loxechinus albus (PLD: 20 d) and Fissurella latimarginata (PLD: 5 d). A sensitivity analysis was used to examine the effect of intrinsic (DVM and PLD) and extrinsic (release depth, latitude, and timing) processes. Release location and timing of release explained respectively 24.30 and 5.54{\%} (F. latimarginata) and 34.8 and 4.19{\%} (L. albus) of the variability observed in recruitment success, and 23.80 and 6.94{\%} (F. latimarginata) and 26.10 and 19.60{\%} (L. albus) of the variability observed in dispersal distance. Most recruitment to local populations was allochthonous, presenting low levels of self-recruitment and local retention, including species with short PLD. Similar geographic patterns of source and destination strengths were observed in both species, showing a geographic mosaic of source and sink populations with relatively higher importance towards the northern region of the study area. Our findings allow us to identify primary determinants of recruitment success and dispersal distance for 2 important exploited species in Chile.},

abstract = { The use of species distribution models (SDMs) has rapidly increased over the last decade, driven largely by increasing observational evidence of distributional shifts of terrestrial and aquatic populations. These models permit, for example, the quantification of range shifts, the estimation of species co-occurrence, and the association of habitat to species distribution and abundance. The increasing complexity of contemporary SDMs presents new challenges—as the choices among modeling options increase, it is essential to understand how these choices affect model outcomes. Using a combination of original analysis and literature review, we synthesize the effects of three common model choices in semi-parametric predictive process species distribution modeling: model structure, spatial extent of the data, and spatial scale of predictions. To illustrate the effects of these choices, we develop a case study centered around sablefish ( Anoplopoma fimbria ) distribution on the west coast of the USA. The three modeling choices represent decisions necessary in virtually all ecological applications of these methods, and are important because the consequences of these choices impact derived quantities of interest ( e.g ., estimates of population size and their management implications). Truncating the spatial extent of data near the observed range edge, or using a model that is misspecified in terms of covariates and spatial and spatiotemporal fields, led to bias in population biomass trends and mean distribution compared to estimates from models using the full dataset and appropriate model structure. In some cases, these suboptimal modeling decisions may be unavoidable, but understanding the tradeoffs of these choices and impacts on predictions is critical. We illustrate how seemingly small model choices, often made out of necessity or simplicity, can affect scientific advice informing management decisions—potentially leading to erroneous conclusions about changes in abundance or distribution and the precision of such estimates. For example, we show how incorrect decisions could cause overestimation of abundance, which could result in management advice resulting in overfishing. Based on these findings and literature gaps, we outline important frontiers in SDM development. },

Understanding the habitat and environmental drivers that lead to areas of high biomass, or ‘hotspots', and their seasonal persistence, will support the identification of important foraging regions for mid- and upper- trophic level predators. We quantify the distribution of hotspots of the two dominant species of euphausiid in the north-east Pacific Ocean: Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, as well as euphausiid larvae (mixed species). The Canadian coast encompasses the northern California Current Ecosystem and the transition zone to the Alaska current, and is a highly productive region for fisheries, marine mammals, and seabirds. We used spatiotemporal modelling to predict the distribution of these three euphausiid groups in relation to geomorphic and environmental variables during the important spring-summer months (April through September) when euphausiid biomass is highest. We quantified the area, intensity, and persistence of biomass hotspots across months according to specific oceanographic ecosections developed for marine spatial planning purposes. Persistent hotspots of both adult species were predicted to occur along the 200 m depth contour of the continental slope; however, differences were predicted on the shallower Dixon shelf, which was a key area for T. spinifera, and within the Juan de Fuca Eddy system where E. pacifica hotspots occurred. The continental slope along the west coast of Vancouver Island was the only persistent hotspot region common between both adult species and euphausiid larvae. Larval distribution was more correlated with T. spinifera than E. pacifica biomass. Hotspots of adults were more persistent across months than hotspots of euphausiid larvae, which were seasonally patchy. The persistence of biomass hotspots of forage species through periods of low overall biomass could maintain trophic connectivity through perturbation events and increase ecosystem resilience to climate change.},

Here, we give an overview of how a metacommunity perspective can provide useful insights for conservation biology, which aims to understand and mitigate the effects of anthropogenic drivers that decrease population sizes, increase extinction probabilities, and threaten biodiversity. We review four general metacommunity processes—environmental filtering, biotic interactions, dispersal, and ecological drift—and discuss how key anthropogenic drivers (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, and nonnative species) can alter these processes. We next describe how the patterns of interest in metacommunities (abundance, occupancy, and diversity) map onto issues at the heart of conservation biology, and describe cases where conservation biology benefits by taking a scale-explicit metacommunity perspective. We conclude with some ways forward for including metacommunity perspectives into ideas of ecosystem functioning and services, as well as approaches to habitat management, preservation, and restoration.},

abstract = {A key challenge for community ecology is to understand to what extent observational data can be used to infer the underlying community assembly processes. As different processes can lead to similar or even identical patterns, statistical analyses of non-manipulative observational data never yield undisputable causal inference on the underlying processes. Still, most empirical studies in community ecology are based on observational data, and hence understanding under which circumstances such data can shed light on assembly processes is a central concern for community ecologists. We simulated a spatial agent-based model that generates variation in metacommunity dynamics across multiple axes, including the four classic metacommunity paradigms as special cases. We further simulated a virtual ecologist who analysed snapshot data sampled from the simulations using eighteen output metrics derived from beta-diversity and habitat variation indices, variation partitioning and joint species distribution modelling. Our results indicated two main axes of variation in the output metrics. The first axis of variation described whether the landscape has patchy or continuous variation, and thus was essentially independent of the properties of the species community. The second axis of variation related to the level of predictability of the metacommunity. The most predictable communities were niche-based metacommunities inhabiting static landscapes with marked environmental heterogeneity, such as metacommunities following the species sorting paradigm or the mass effects paradigm. The most unpredictable communities were neutral-based metacommunities inhabiting dynamics landscapes with little spatial heterogeneity, such as metacommunities following the neutral or patch sorting paradigms. The output metrics from joint species distribution modelling yielded generally the highest resolution to disentangle among the simulated scenarios. Yet, the different types of statistical approaches utilized in this study carried complementary information, and thus our results suggest that the most comprehensive evaluation of metacommunity structure can be obtained by combining them.},

Here, we use a novel experimental approach to rear larvae under interacting gradients of temperature, salinity, and ocean acidification, then model growth rate and duration of Olympia oyster larvae and predict the suitability of habitats for larval survival. We find that temperature and salinity are closely linked to larval growth and larval habitat suitability, but larvae are tolerant to acidification at this scale. We discover that present conditions in the Salish Sea are actually suboptimal for Olympia oyster larvae from populations in the region, and that larvae from these populations might actually benefit from some degree of global ocean change. Our models predict a vast decrease in mean pelagic larval duration by the year 2095, which has the potential to alter population dynamics for this species in future oceans. Additionally, we find that larval tolerance can explain large-scale biogeographic patterns for this species across its range.},

We present a unified, parameterized model for the temperature dependence of larval development in marine animals.

abstract = {Effective networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) are explicitly recognized and called for in international biodiversity conservation strategies such as the Aichi Targets. While various indicators have been proposed to assess effectiveness of individual MPAs, no comprehensive set of indicators exists for MPA networks, particularly for Aichi Target 11. The qualitative elements of this target recognize the value of social, economic, governance, and ecological factors in achieving effective biodiversity conservation. Here, we used a systematic literature review to identify indicators of MPA network effectiveness. We reviewed 64 publications, identifying 48 indicators that could be aligned with the qualitative elements. Results showed that assessments of MPA network effectiveness predominantly focused on effective management while neglecting equitable management and integration into the wider land and seascape. Indicators tended to focus on ecological characteristics, overlooking social, economic, and governance dimensions. Key challenges in addressing these gaps include identifying conflicting priorities and objectives in adjacent marine and land areas that interfere with cooperation and knowledge sharing, and ensuring diverse areas with distinct social and ecological contexts are considered. This study provides the first review of indicators for assessing MPA networks and adds to the literature assessing whether current and future targets can be met.},
