  abstract = {Humans interact with the oceans in diverse and profound ways. The scope, magnitude, footprint and ultimate cumulative impacts of human activities can threaten ocean ecosystems and have changed over time, resulting in new challenges and threats to marine ecosystems. A fundamental gap in understanding how humanity is affecting the oceans is our limited knowledge about the pace of change in cumulative impact on ocean ecosystems from expanding human activities – and the patterns, locations and drivers of most significant change. To help address this, we combined high resolution, annual data on the intensity of 14 human stressors and their impact on 21 marine ecosystems over 11 years (2003–2013) to assess pace of change in cumulative impacts on global oceans, where and how much that pace differs across the ocean, and which stressors and their impacts contribute most to those changes. We found that most of the ocean (59\%) is experiencing significantly increasing cumulative impact, in particular due to climate change but also from fishing, land-based pollution and shipping. Nearly all countries saw increases in cumulative impacts in their coastal waters, as did all ecosystems, with coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves at most risk. Mitigation of stressors most contributing to increases in overall cumulative impacts is urgently needed to sustain healthy oceans.},

  abstract = {Human population density within 100 km of the sea is approximately three times higher than the global average. People in this zone are concentrated in coastal cities that are hubs for transport and trade ? which transform the marine environment. Here, we review the impacts of three interacting drivers of marine urbanization (resource exploitation, pollution pathways and ocean sprawl) and discuss key characteristics that are symptomatic of urban marine ecosystems. Current evidence suggests these systems comprise spatially heterogeneous mosaics with respect to artificial structures, pollutants and community composition, while also undergoing biotic homogenization over time. Urban marine ecosystem dynamics are often influenced by several commonly observed patterns and processes, including the loss of foundation species, changes in biodiversity and productivity, and the establishment of novel assemblages, ruderal species and synanthropes. Further, we discuss potential urban acclimatization and adaptation among marine taxa, interactive effects of climate change and marine urbanization, and ecological engineering strategies for enhancing urban marine ecosystems. By assimilating research findings across disparate disciplines, we aim to build the groundwork for urban marine ecology ? a nascent field; we also discuss research challenges and future directions for this new field as it advances and matures. Ultimately, all sides of coastal city design: architecture, urban planning, and civil and municipal engineering, will need to prioritize the marine environment if negative effects of urbanization are to be minimized. In particular, planning strategies that account for the interactive effects of urban drivers and accommodate complex system dynamics could enhance the ecological and human functions of future urban marine ecosystems.

For three small estuaries in the Southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, changes in eelgrass area coverage and shape index (over the period of 1932-2016) were assessed using historical aerial photographs and unoccupied aerial system (UAS) imagery. In addition, changes in eelgrass area and shape index were evaluated in relation to landscape-level coastal environmental indicators, namely shoreline activities and alterations and residential housing density. All three eelgrass meadows showed a deteriorating trend in eelgrass condition; on average, eelgrass area coverage decreased by 45.1\%, while meadow complexity as indicated by the shape index increased by 66.3\%. Shoreline activities (boats, docks, log booms, and armoring) and residential housing density increased markedly at all sites over the study period and were strongly correlated to eelgrass area coverage and shape index. Changes in these landscape-level indicators over this period corroborate the observed decline in eelgrass habitat condition, because they suggest an overall deterioration of coastal environmental health in the Salish Sea due to increased use of the coastal zone, as well as declines in water quality due to urbanization.},

Availability of spatial data on the location of human activities on or affecting the ocean has substantially improved our understanding of potential cumulative effects. However, datasets for some activities remain poor and increased access to current, high resolution data are needed. Here we present an updated analysis of potential cumulative effects in Canada's Pacific marine waters. New, updated datasets and methodological improvements over the previous analysis were completed, including a new index for land-based effects on marine habitats, updated habitat classes and a modified treatment of vulnerability scores. The results show increased potential cumulative effects for the region. Fishing remains the biggest overall impact amongst marine activities, while land-based activities have the highest impact per unit area in affected ocean areas. Intertidal areas were the most affected habitat per unit area, while pelagic habitats had the highest total cumulative effect score. Regular updates of cumulative effects assessments will make them more useful for management, but these require regularly updated, high resolution datasets across all activity types, and automated, well-documented procedures to make them accessible to managers and policy-makers.},

  abstract = {The dispersal of marine organisms is a critical process for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across a seascape. Understanding the patterns of habitat connectivity that arise from the movement of multiple species can highlight the role of regional processes in maintaining local community structure. However, quantifying the probability and scale of dispersal for marine organisms remains a challenge. Here, we use a biophysical model to simulate dispersal, and we conduct a network analysis to predict connectivity patterns across scales for the community of invertebrates associated with seagrass habitat in British Columbia, Canada. We found many possible connections and few isolated habitat meadows, but the probability of most connections was low. Most habitat connections occurred within 3 days of dispersal time over short distances, indicating potential limits to long distance dispersal and little effect of species-specific dispersal abilities on the potential spatial extent of habitat connectivity. We then highlight the different roles that individual seagrass meadows can play in maintaining network connectivity. We also identify clusters of connected meadows and use these clusters to estimate the spatial scale of community dynamics. The connectivity patterns generated by our dispersal simulations highlight the importance of considering marine communities in their broad seascape context, with applications for the prioritization and conservation of habitat that maintains connectivity.},

  abstract = {Shoreline armoring is widespread in many parts of the protected inland waters of the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A, but impacts on physical and biological features of local nearshore ecosystems have only recently begun to be documented. Armoring marine shorelines can alter natural processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales; some, such as starving the beach of sediments by blocking input from upland bluffs may take decades to become visible, while others such as placement loss of armoring construction are immediate. We quantified a range of geomorphic and biological parameters at paired, nearby armored and unarmored beaches throughout the inland waters of Washington State to test what conditions and parameters are associated with armoring. We gathered identical datasets at a total of 65 pairs of beaches: 6 in South Puget Sound, 23 in Central Puget Sound, and 36 pairs North of Puget Sound proper. At this broad scale, demonstrating differences attributable to armoring is challenging given the high natural variability in measured parameters among beaches and regions. However, we found that armoring was consistently associated with reductions in beach width, riparian vegetation, numbers of accumulated logs, and amounts and types of beach wrack and associated invertebrates. Armoring-related patterns at lower beach elevations (further vertically from armoring) were progressively harder to detect. For some parameters, such as accumulated logs, there was a distinct threshold in armoring elevation that was associated with increased impacts. This large dataset for the first time allowed us to identify cumulative impacts that appear when increasing proportions of shorelines are armored. At large spatial and temporal scales, armoring much of a sediment drift cell may result in reduction of the finer grain-size fractions on beaches, including those used by spawning forage fish. Overall we have shown that local impacts of shoreline armoring can scale-up to have cumulative and threshold effects -- these should be considered when managing impacts to public resources along the coast.},

Scientific data on these supralittoral areas, frequently called the "marine riparian" by managers are scarce in Pacific region. Habitat and ocean managers are dealing with uncertainty when assessing these areas in relation to forestry, urban development, and other industrial activities. There is evidence showing that unvegetated beach substrate in the marine riparian is used as spawning and incubation habitat for sandlance and surf smelt. Marine riparian is also recognized as rearing and migratory habitat for juvenile salmonids. Preliminary studies conducted at two locations in the Strait of Georgia in February and March 2001 showed that a variety of arthropods are potentially available as fish food from intact marine riparian habitats. The functional importance of marine riparian is likely to be related to food production, temperature regulation, wave energy absorption, and provision of structure as well as indirect ecological value. As an interim measure, based on the sparse available literature, we recommend that a site specific approach be taken to buffer zone widths to manage the marine riparian. Gravel, sand, or cobble beaches may be most susceptible to erosion and sediment sloughing from land, depending on backshore conditions. We also advise a careful review of the rationale, efficacy, and performance of the setback distances proposed in Clayoquot Sound and Puget Sound. Several focused research projects are recommended.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we explicitly link changes in community structure of estuarine primary producers to measured nitrogen loading rates from watersheds to estuaries, and quantify the relationship between nitrogen load, annual dynamics of algal growth and Zostera marina L. productivity, and overall eelgrass decline at the watershed-estuarine scale in estuaries of Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, USA. Substantial eelgrass loss (80 to 96\% of bed area lost in the last decade) was found at loads of \textasciitilde 30 kg N ha–1 yr–1, and total disappearance at loads ≥ 60 kg N ha–1 yr–1. Rather than decreased eelgrass growth rates, we observed an exponential decrease in shoot densities and bed area (and subsequently, areal production) as nitrogen loads increased, suggesting that eelgrass decline in higher-nitrogen estuaries of the Waquoit system occurred largely via lack of recruitment or enhanced mortality of established shoots. Similar to the patterns observed in many other systems and the experimental results obtained in laboratories or mesocosms, the relationship we observed between nitrogen loads and eelgrass health within the Waquoit system was indirect: increased nitrogen stimulated growth and standing stocks of algal producers, that may have caused severe light limitation of eelgrass. From light budgets that considered water column, epiphyte, and macroalgal shading, we estimated chronic, severe light limitation to newly recruiting shoots in higher-nitrogen estuaries, due mainly to shading by a coexisting ≤15 cm macroalgal canopy. Two management recommendations aimed at eelgrass preservation emerge from this work. First, development and management of watersheds must be conducted such that land-derived nitrogen loading to estuaries is restricted. In the Waquoit Bay estuaries, for example, eelgrass is absent or rapidly disappearing from all but those receiving the lowest (≤15th percentile) loads. Second, shoot density and meadow area, rather than growth rates per shoot, seem to be adequate variables for routine monitoring of eelgrass health. We also show that the shift from eelgrass- to algae-dominated communities has important consequences for total system primary production and carbon and nitrogen cycling. Estimated total primary production by coastal assemblages in the Waquoit Bay system was 135\% higher in estuaries receiving relatively high versus low loads of land-derived nitrogen, suggesting important trophic and biogeochemical alterations to temperate estuarine ecosystems as a result of eutrophication.},

  abstract = {Effective coastal conservation requires a better understanding of how human activities on land may directly and indirectly affect adjacent marine communities. However, the relationship between terrestrial and marine systems has rarely been considered in terrestrial and marine reserve design. Seagrasses are affected by land-based activities due to their proximity to terrestrial systems and sensitivity to fluxes of terrestrially-derived organic and inorganic material. Our study examines how land use patterns adjacent to seagrass meadows influence the ecological integrity of seagrass using a suite of seagrass condition metrics on a landscape level across the Philippine archipelago. Using canonical correlation analysis, we measured the association between environmental variables (land use and seagrass abiotic conditions) with biotic variables (seagrass species richness and abundance). Terrestrial protection adjacent to seagrass meadows, defined as the absence of various anthropogenic land use perturbations, had significant positive effects on seagrass condition. The watershed area, and area of farmland and human development, had the most negative effect on seagrass condition. Using analysis of covariance and regression, we examined how marine protected area (MPA) establishment, size, and age, affected seagrass biotic conditions while holding environmental conditions constant. The relationship between biological and environmental canonical factors did not vary as a function of an MPA. This study provides evidence that land use is more important than marine protection for tropical seagrass condition. Our results demonstrate the complementary connection between land and sea, justifying the ‘ridge-to-reef’ approach in coastal conservation. Proper management of seagrasses should account for stewardship of the adjacent watersheds.},
